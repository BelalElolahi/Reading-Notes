# In memory storage

## JavaScript Call Stack
 a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

**LIFO**: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

##### Example of Call stake below :
+ first execution in 4 call stack **LIFO** 
+ Last execution in 7 call stack

###  stack overflow
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

Here is an example:

###### function callMyself(){
  ######  callMyself();
###### }

###### callMyself();

## JavaScript error messages 
### Types of error messages:

+ Reference errors :

    This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
+ Syntax errors : 

  I know itâ€™s in the name of the errors, but like it says itself, this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.


+ Range errors

 Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.



+ Type errors
 Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

#### Debugging
 Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as 'bugs') in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. To prevent incorrect operation of a software or system, debugging is used to find and resolve bugs or defects.

 ##### What is the breakPoint
 a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. 

**Debugger** 
 its help determine and  able to locate the error and work on testing the code to make sure that it is free of error by tracing the lines in which the error is located.
