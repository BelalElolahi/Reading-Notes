## SQL V NoSQL
SQL| NoSQL
------------ | -------------
 relational| non-relational
databases are table-based|databases are document
better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON|key-value, graph, or wide-column stores
SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware| NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful| NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents.

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment


### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
 NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

 SQL databases are not suitable for hierarchical data storage. However, the NoSQL database is better suited for hierarchical data storage because it follows the key-value pair method or graph method. NoSQL databases are highly preferred for large data sets.

 SQL and NoSQL is their scalability. Most SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing components like RAM, SSD, or CPU.




### SQL 
(pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems

#### Relational databases
Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

#### relational database work.
The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure

#### schema:
A database schema is an abstract design that represents the storage of your data in a database. It describes both the organization of data and the relationships between tables in a given database. Developers plan a database schema in advance so they know what components are necessary and how they will connect to each other.




### NoSQL
A NoSQL (originally referring to "non-SQL" or "non-relational")[1] database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

#### How does it work ? 
NoSQL is an approach to databases that represents a shift away from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). ... Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models.
#### What does Mongodb contain?
MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

#### disadvantage of a NoSQL
* Not all NoSQL databases contemplate the atomicity of instructions and the integrity of the data. ...
* Compatibility issues with SQL instructions. ...
* Lack of standardizing. ...
* Cross-platform support. ...
* They usually have not-really-useful management tools or console access.
