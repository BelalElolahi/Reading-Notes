# Greed Game 
 The main difference is that in Greed a player's score is banked when they have (what in farkle is called) hot dice, so they don't risk it in rolling a fresh set of six dice. All of the other scoring and play characteristics fall within the range of variations reported for farkle. Also, the article is rather sloppy and has some grammatical errors. Given all that, one could argue for deleting with a redirect to farkle, as long as slight changes are made to the farkle page acknowledging greed as a name for a variant in which scores are not risked in throwing hot dice


 Farkle is a variation of greed, yes, or vice-versa. It has been difficult to track the origin to the game. I found that there are nearly a hundred different ways to play, ranging from differences in the number of dice to the ways you score. Yet, all of these games were similar enough to be considered a variant of play - just as Farkle is


 I second the motion that this be absorbed into the Farkle page, maybe with a rehashing of the rule variants specific to this game. As I've played it, scores are risked when throwing hot dice. Also we required that all scoring dice be kept, as opposed to the rules of Farkle appear to allow you to pick and choose which dice to keep


## How to use the Random Module in Python

Python Random module is an in-built module of Python which is used to generate random numbers. These are pseudo-random numbers means these are not truly random. This module can be used to perform random actions such as generating random numbers, print random a value for a list or string

### Random functions
#### Randint
If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

>>> import random

>>>print random.randint(0, 5)

>>>This will output either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

#### Random
If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.

For example, a random number between 0 and 100:

>>>import random

>>>random.random() * 100

#### Choice

Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

>>random.choice( ['red', 'black', 'green'] ).

The choice function can often be used for choosing a random element from a list.

>>import random

>>myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)

#### Shuffle
The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

random.shuffle(list) Example taken from this post on Stackoverflow

>>from random import shuffle

>>x = [[i] for i in range(10)]

>>shuffle(x)

>>Output:
 
 >>print x  gives  [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]
 
 >>of course your results will vary

#### Randrange
Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

>>random.randrange(start, stop[, step])

>>import random

>>for i in range(3):

  >>print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)

>>Code Example

## risk analysis 
is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

### Why use Risk Analysis?

In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.


### Risk Identification

There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:

Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.

After identifying the risks associated with your software, the next step is to assess the risks; i.e, Risk Assessment.

### Risk Assessment
In the risk analysis process, these steps prove to be the most important one. It is said that this step is way too complex and should be tackled with the utmost care. After risk identification, assessment has to be dealt programmatically. There are a few perspectives on risk assessment.

#### The perspective of Risk Assessment
There are three perspectives of Risk Assessment:


+ Effect – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

+ Cause – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.

+ Likelihood – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.


### How to perform Risk Analysis?
There are three steps:

+ Searching the risk

+ Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

+ Measures for the risk identified

## TestCoverage 

Test coverage is defined as a metric in Software Testing that measures the amount of testing performed by a set of test. It will include gathering information about which parts of a program are executed when running the test suite to determine which branches of conditional statements have been taken.

In simple terms, it is a technique to ensure that your tests are testing your code or how much of your code you exercised by running the test.

![](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/testCoverage/sketch.png)

Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase. Test coverage is of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are.

#### Benefits of Test Coverage
+  It can assure the quality of the test

+ It can help identify what portions of the code were actually 

+ touched for the release or fix
+ It can help to determine the paths in your application that were not tested
+ Prevent Defect leakage

+ Time, scope and cost can be kept under control
+ Defect prevention at an early stage of the project lifecycle
+ It can determine all the decision points and paths used in the application, which allows you to increase test coverage

+ Gaps in requirements, test cases and defects at the unit level and code level can be found in an easy way
