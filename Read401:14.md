# Data Visualization
## Matplotlib tutorial
matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases.

**IPython**
IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more. It allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.

**pyplot**
pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.


### Simple Plot
The simple plot is defined as a unified construct of necessary and probable actions accompanied by a change of fortune. Change of fortune is a crucial aspect of this type of plot â€” particularly the word change.

Create a simple plot.
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Data for plotting
t = np.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
s = 1 + np.sin(2 * np.pi * t)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(t, s)

ax.set(xlabel='time (s)', ylabel='voltage (mV)',
       title='About as simple as it gets, folks')
ax.grid()

fig.savefig("test.png")
plt.show()
```

### Figures
A figure is the windows in the GUI that has "Figure #" as title. Figures are numbered starting from 1 as opposed to the normal Python way starting from 0. This is clearly MATLAB-style. There are several parameters that determine what the figure looks like:


### Subplots
 With subplot you can arrange plots in a regular grid. You need to specify the number of rows and columns and the number of the plot. Note that the gridspec command is a more powerful alternative.

### Axes
Axes are very similar to subplots but allow placement of plots at any location in the figure. So if we want to put a smaller plot inside a bigger one we do so with axes.

### Ticks
Well formatted ticks are an important part of publishing-ready figures. Matplotlib provides a totally configurable system for ticks. There are tick locators to specify where ticks should appear and tick formatters to give ticks the appearance you want. Major and minor ticks can be located and formatted independently from each other

```
ax = plt.gca()
ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(eval(locator))


```
There are several locators for different kind of requirements:

### Animation
For quite a long time, animation in matplotlib was not an easy task and was done mainly through clever hacks. However, things have started to change since version 1.1 and the introduction of tools for creating animation very intuitively, with the possibility to save them in all kind of formats (but don't expect to be able to run very complex animations at 60 fps though).
```
# Number of ring
n = 50
size_min = 50
size_max = 50*50

# Ring position
P = np.random.uniform(0,1,(n,2))

# Ring colors
C = np.ones((n,4)) * (0,0,0,1)
# Alpha color channel goes from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque)
C[:,3] = np.linspace(0,1,n)

# Ring sizes
S = np.linspace(size_min, size_max, n)

# Scatter plot
scat = ax.scatter(P[:,0], P[:,1], s=S, lw = 0.5,
                  edgecolors = C, facecolors='None')

# Ensure limits are [0,1] and remove ticks
ax.set_xlim(0,1), ax.set_xticks([])
ax.set_ylim(0,1), ax.set_yticks([])

```

### Earthquakes
We'll now use the rain animation to visualize earthquakes on the planet from the last 30 days. The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and provides several data on their website. Those data are sorted according to earthquakes magnitude, ranging from significant only down to all earthquakes, major or minor. You would be surprised by the number of minor earthquakes happening every hour on the planet. Since this would represent too much data for us, we'll stick to earthquakes with magnitude > 4.5. At the time of writing, this already represent more than 300 earthquakes in the last 30 days.


### Other Types of Plots
#### Regular Plots
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

n = 256
X = np.linspace(-np.pi,np.pi,n,endpoint=True)
Y = np.sin(2*X)

plt.plot (X, Y+1, color='blue', alpha=1.00)
plt.plot (X, Y-1, color='blue', alpha=1.00)
plt.show()
```

#### Scatter Plots
