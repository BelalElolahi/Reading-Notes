# State and Props
## What types of things can you pass in the props?
Props are Read-Only
Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:

###### function sum(a, b) {
 ###### return a + b;
###### }
Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:

###### function withdraw(account, amount) {
  ###### account.total -= amount;
###### }
React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:

All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the next section, we will introduce a new concept of “state”. State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.
## What is the big difference between props and state?
**props** are used by a component to get data from external environment i.e another component ( pure, functional or class) or a general class or javascript/typescript code

**states** are used to manage the internal environment of a component means the data changes inside the component

## When do we re-render our application?
React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props. A simple update of the state, from anywhere in the code, causes all the User Interface (UI) elements to be re-rendered automatically. However, there may be cases where the render() method depends on some other data.
## What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
It stores updatable values
For example, the counter variable increases and  decreases it's depend on existing logic sense
and the counter hold in or stored in the state
