# Readings: React and Forms
## Forms
The <FormControl> component renders a form control with Bootstrap styling. The <FormGroup> component wraps a form control with proper spacing, along with support for a label, help text, and validation state. To ensure accessibility, set controlId on <FormGroup>, and use <FormLabel> for the label.

## Controlled Components


React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way

Wehould  update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them
With a controlled component, the inputâ€™s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

Handling Multiple Inputs
When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of **event.target.name** .


## Ternary Operator Explained

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement.


### Syntax : 
   let y = (x===y) ? true : false;
         
         condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
  

  + condition
An expression whose value is used as a condition.

+ exprIfTrue
An expression which is evaluated if the condition evaluates to a truthy value (one which equals or can be converted to true).

+ exprIfFalse
An expression which is executed if the condition is falsy (that is, has a value which can be converted to false).
