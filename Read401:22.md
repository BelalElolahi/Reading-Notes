# Django Custom User

Django ships with a built-in User model for authentication and if you'd like a basic tutorial on how to implement log in, log out, sign up and so on see the Django Login and Logout tutorial for more.

However, for a real-world project, the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model instead. This provides far more flexibility down the line so, as a general rule, always use a custom user model for all new Django projects.

## AbstractUser
AbstractUser class inherits the User class and is used to add Additional Fields required for your User in Database itself. SO its change the schema of the database. It is basically used to add fields like date_of_birth , location and bio etc. to the existing User model This is Done to the very Beginning of the project. which means you will get the complete field which by default come with the user Model plus the following field that you add/define.



## AbstractBaseUser
AbstractBaseUser has the authentication functionality only , it has no actual fields you will supply the fields to use when you subclass.
you have to till that what field represent username fields, and how those users will be managed

how to implement one  :


## Setup

Here are the commands to run:
```
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir accounts && cd accounts
$ pipenv install django~=3.1.0
$ pipenv shell
(accounts) $ django-admin.py startproject config .
(accounts) $ python manage.py startapp accounts
(accounts) $ python manage.py runserver
```

## Custom User Model
Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

+ update config/settings.py
+ create a new CustomUser model
+ create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm
+ update the admin


Within `INSTALLED_APPS` add accounts at the bottom. Then at the bottom of the entire file, add the AUTH_USER_MODEL config.
```
# config/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'accounts', # new
]
...
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser' # new

```

Now update `accounts/models.py `with a new User model which we'll call CustomUser.

```
# accounts/models.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    pass
    # add additional fields in here

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
```

We need new versions of two form methods that receive heavy use working with users. Stop the local server with Control+c and create a new file in the `accounts` app called `forms.py`.

```
# accounts/forms.py
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm, UserChangeForm
from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):

    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ('username', 'email')

class CustomUserChangeForm(UserChangeForm):

    class Meta:
        model = CustomUser
        fields = ('username', 'email')
```

Finally we update `admin.py` since the Admin is highly coupled to the default User model.
```
# accounts/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin

from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm, CustomUserChangeForm
from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
    add_form = CustomUserCreationForm
    form = CustomUserChangeForm
    model = CustomUser
    list_display = ['email', 'username',]

admin.site.register(CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin)


```




# DjangoX

I recently open-sourced DjangoX which is my own opinionated starter framework  It comes with a custom user model by default, email/password authentication instead of Django’s default and outdated username/email/password pattern, and is fully extendable with social authentication like Gmail, Facebook, and more.

Time and again on new Django projects I found myself wanting these same basic configuration options yet I’m not aware of an open-source project providing them. The leading Django starter framework is cookiecutter-django and DjangoX is heavily by its example. I learned a lot about Django from reading through the source code. However I often found cookiecutter to be too much for my own personal needs.

There is a temptation for me to continue adding features to DjangoX such as integration with PostgreSQL/Docker, environment variables, third-party packages like django-debug-toolbar and django-extensions, admin hardening, and more. But I want the project to remain accessible to newcomers and flexible enough to support any number of custom configurations beyond what I consider the absolute essentials for any new project.
