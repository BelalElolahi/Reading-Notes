# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions
## HTML Tables
The **<**table**>** HTML element represents tabular data — that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.

Define an HTML Table
The **<**table**>** tag defines an HTML table.

Each table row is defined with a **<**tr**>** tag. Each table header is defined with a **<**th**>** tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a **<**td**>** tag.

By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered.

By default, the text in <td> elements are regular and left-aligned.

## JS Constructor Functions

A constructor is a function that creates an instance of a class which is typically called an “object”. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when you declare an object using the new keyword.

The purpose of a constructor is to create an object and set values if there are any object properties present. It’s a neat way to create an object because you do not need to explicitly state what to return as the constructor function, by default, returns the object that gets created within it.

What happens when a constructor gets called?
In JavaScript, here’s what happens when a constructor is invoked:

A new empty object is created

this keyword starts referring to that newly created object and hence it becomes the current instance object

The newly created object is then returned as the constructor’s returned value
