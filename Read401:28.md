# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

`Vertex` - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

`Edge` - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

`Neighbor` - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

`Degree` - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected
### undirected graph 
In an undirected graph, nodes are connected by edges that are all bidirectional. For example if an edge connects node 1 and 2, we can traverse from node 1 to node 2, and from node 2 to 1.

### Directed Graph

In a directed graph, nodes are connected by directed edges – they only go in one direction. For example, if an edge connects node 1 and 2, but the arrow head points towards 2, we can only traverse from node 1 to node 2 – not in the opposite direction.

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
### Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

Take a close look at each of the vertices in the graph above. Do you notice that each vertex is actually connected to every other node on the graph? That is what makes it a complete graph.

### Connected
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

In the visual above, this looks a lot more than what you are used to seeing. If you look closely at the different vertices of the graph, you will see that each node is connected to at least one other node or vertices. A Tree is a form of a connected graph. We will talk more about that in a bit.

###Disconnected
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

In the above visual, the disconnected graph shows that some nodes may not always be connected to other nodes or vertices of the graph. It is complelty possible to have standalone nodes or edges (also known as islands) in a graph data structure.







##  Acyclic vs Cyclic


### Acyclic Graph
When there are no cycles in a graph, it is called an acyclic graph.

### Cyclic Graph
If a graph contains at least one graph cycle, it is considered to be cyclic.

## Types of Graph Representations:

### Adjacency List

To create an Adjacency list, an array of lists is used. The size of the array is equal to the number of nodes.

A single index, array[i] represents the list of nodes adjacent to the ith node.

### Adjacency Matrix:

An Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of nodes in a graph. A slot matrix[i][j] = 1 indicates that there is an edge from node i to node j.

## Graph Traversal Algorithm 
The process of visiting or updating each vertex in a graph is known as graph traversal. The sequence in which they visit the vertices is used to classify such traversals. Graph traversal is a subset of tree traversal.

There are two techniques to implement a graph traversal algorithm:

+ Breadth-first search
+ Depth-first search



## Basic Operations
Following are basic primary operations of a Graph −

`Add Vertex `− Adds a vertex to the graph.

`Add Edge` − Adds an edge between the two vertices of the graph.

`Display Vertex `− Displays a vertex of the graph.
