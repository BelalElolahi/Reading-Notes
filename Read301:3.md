# Readings: Passing Functions as Props

##  lists and keys

“key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements

The perpos of Keys 
 help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.

**map()**  return object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable.

Each list item needs a unique Key.

Syntax  ListItems  in JSX:

## The Spread Operator 
The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

spread operator is useful for many different routine tasks in JavaScript Like: 
 * Copying an array
* Concatenating or combining arrays
* Using Math functions
* Using an array as arguments
* Adding an item to a list
* Adding to state in React
* Combining objects
* Converting NodeList to an array
 

 ##### Combine two arrays, Copy ,  Passing as a arguments examples:

##  Pass Functions Between Components
##### In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

Creating Functions at the State Level  , parent components .

#####  what does the increment function do?

Function that take  a name  to increment the count in person object
once we click in specifiec opject.

##### How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component? 

It's normal , like we pass a props to the child component  'use this.FunctionName'.

##### How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component? 
it's props, we can invoke the methode any where in the component 'this.props.methodName()'
