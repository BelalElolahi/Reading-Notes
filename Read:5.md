# HTML Images, Css Color, Text
## HTML Images
The HTML **<**img**>** tag is used to embed an image in a web page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. ... The **<**img**>** tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag. The **<**img**>** tag has two required attributes: src - Specifies the path to the image.

The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

Note: When a web page loads; it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.

There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.

 There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.

 If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.

You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
 
 You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
