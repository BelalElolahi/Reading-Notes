## Dunder Methods
### What Are Dunder Methods?
In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example `__init__` or `__str__`.
```
class NoLenSupport:
    pass

>>> obj = NoLenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
TypeError: "object of type 'NoLenSupport' has no len()"

```
To fix this, you can add a __len__ dunder method to your class:
```
class LenSupport:
    def __len__(self):
        return 42

>>> obj = LenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
42 
```
Another example is slicing. You can implement a `__getitem__` method which allows you to use Python’s list slicing syntax: obj[start:stop].

## Python Iterators
Iterator in python is an object that is used to iterate over iterable objects like lists, tuples, dicts, and sets. The iterator object is initialized using the iter() method. It uses the next() method for iteration. ... This method raises a StopIteration to signal the end of the iteration.

+ Iterators provide a sequence interface to Python objects that’s memory efficient and considered Pythonic. Behold the beauty of the for-in loop!
+ To support iteration an object needs to implement the iterator protocol by providing the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods.
+ Class-based iterators are only one way to write iterable objects in Python. Also consider generators and generator expressions.

##  Python Generators

There is a lot of work in building an iterator in Python. We have to implement a class with` __iter__()` and `__next__(`) method, keep track of internal states, and raise StopIteration when there are no values to be returned.

This is both lengthy and counterintuitive. Generator comes to the rescue in such situations.

Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators. All the work we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python.

Simply speaking, a generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).

#### Create Generators in Python
It is fairly simple to create a generator in Python. It is as easy as defining a normal function, but with a `yield` statement instead of a `return` statement.

If a function contains at least one `yield` statement (it may contain other `yield` or return statements), it becomes a generator function. Both `yield` and return will `return` some value from a function.

The difference is that while a `return` statement terminates a function entirely, `yield` statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.
