## Java script
#### JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript. 
 
 #### What is JavaScript used for?

   Adding interactive behavior to web pages
JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages. There are almost no limits to the things you can do with JavaScript on a web page â€“ these are just a few examples:

Show or hide more information with the click of a button

Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers over it

Slide through a carousel of images on the homepage

Zooming in or zooming out on an image

Displaying a timer or count-down on a website

Playing audio and video in a web page

Displaying animations

Using a drop-down hamburger menu

### JavaScript  Samples code : 
#### Declarations
JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.

##### var
Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
##### let
Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
##### const
Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.
###### var _lastName = "Johnson";
###### var _x = 2;
###### var _100 = 5;




### JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

##### Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
##### Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
##### Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
##### Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
#### In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

##### Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
##### Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
##### Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
##### Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
###### if (hour < 18) {
 ###### greeting = "Good day";
###### } else {
 ###### greeting = "Good evening";
###### }
