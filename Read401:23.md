# Hashtables

Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.

Thus, it becomes a data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the data. Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hash technique to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or is to be located from.



## Terminology :

+ `Hash` - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.

+ `Buckets` - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.

+ `Collisions` - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

## Hashing
Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array. We're going to use modulo operator to get a range of key values. Consider an example of hash table of size 20, and the following items are to be stored. Item are in the (key,value) format.

Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.

Let a hash function H(x) maps the value x at the index x%10 in an Array. For example if the list of values is [11,12,13,14,15] it will be stored at positions {1,2,3,4,5} in the array or Hash table respectively.

## Basic Operations
Following are the basic primary operations of a hash table.

`Search` − Searches an element in a hash table.

`Insert` − inserts an element in a hash table.

`delete` − Deletes an element from a hash table.


### Inserting data operation
The insert operation is used to store values in the hash table. When a new value is stored in the hash table, it is assigned an index number. The index number is calculated using the hash function. The hash function resolves any collisions that occur when calculating the index number.


### Search for data operation
The search operation is used to look-up values in the hash table using the index number. The search operation returns the value that is linked to the search index number. For example, if we store the value 6 at index 2, the search operation with index number 2 will return the value 6.

### Delete data operation
The delete operation is used to remove a value from a hash table. To delete the Operation is done using the index number. Once a value has been deleted, the index number is made free. It can be used to store other values using the insert operation.
