#  Introduction to React and Components 
## react 
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

## component
#### What is a component?
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

#### What are the charactistics of a component?
**Reusability** − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

**Replaceable** − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

**Not context specific** − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

**Extensible** − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

**Encapsulated** − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

**Independent** − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
#### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
+ Ease of deployment
+ Reduced cost
+ Ease of development
+ Reusable
+ Modification of technical complexity
+ Reliability
+ System maintenance and evolution
+ Independent

#### What is props short for?
**“Props”** is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.


React is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props.


#### How are props used in React?
1-Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)

2-Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props

3-Finally, render the Props Data

#### What is the flow of props?
Adding Flow types to your React components is incredibly powerful. After typing your component, Flow will statically ensure that you are using the component in the way it was designed to be used.

Early in React’s history the library provided PropTypes which performed basic runtime checks. Flow is much more powerful as it can tell you when you are misusing a component without running your code.

There are some Babel plugins which will generate PropTypes from Flow types such as babel-plugin-react-flow-props-to-prop-types if you want both static and runtime checks.
