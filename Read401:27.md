##  Configuring Django Settings: Best Practices 
### Setting Configuration: Different Approaches
There is no built-in universal way to configure Django settings without hardcoding them. But books, open-source and work projects provide a lot of recommendations and approaches on how to do it best. Let’s take a brief look at the most popular ones to examine their weaknesses and strengths.

### settings_local.py
This is the oldest method. I used it when I was configuring a Django project on a production server for the first time. I saw a lot of people use it back in the day, and I still see it now.

The basic idea of this method is to extend all environment-specific settings in the settings_local.py file, which is ignored by VCS. Here’s an example:



`settings.py file:`

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com']
DEBUG = False
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'production_db',
        'USER': 'user',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'db.example.com',
        'PORT': '5432',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'sslmode': 'require'
        }
    }
}
```


```
from .settings_local import *
view rawlocal_approach_settings.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub
settings_local.py file:

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost']
DEBUG = True
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'local_db',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

### Separate settings file for each environment
This is an extension of the previous approach. It allows you to keep all configurations in VCS and to share default settings between developers.

In this case, you make a settings package with the following file structure:
```
settings/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── base.py
   ├── ci.py
   ├── local.py
   ├── staging.py
   ├── production.py
   └── qa.py
settings/local.py:
```
```
from .base import *


ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost']
DEBUG = True
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'local_db',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

`Pros`:

+ All environments are in VCS.
+ It’s easy to share settings between developers.

`Cons`:
+ You need to find a way to handle secret passwords and tokens.
+ “Inheritance” of settings can be hard to trace and maintain.


### Environment variables
To solve the issue with sensitive data, you can use environment variables.
import os

```
SECRET_KEY = os.environ['SECRET_KEY']
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': os.environ['DATABASE_NAME'],
        'HOST': os.environ['DATABASE_HOST'],
        'PORT': int(os.environ['DATABASE_PORT']),
    }
}
```

view rawenv_approach_settings.py hosted with ❤ by GitHub
This is the simplest example using Python os.environ and it has several issues:

You need to handle KeyError exceptions.
You need to convert types manually (see DATABASE_PORT usage).
To fix KeyError, you can write your own custom wrapper. For example:

import os

from django.core.exceptions import ImproperlyConfigured

```
def get_env_value(env_variable):
    try:
      	return os.environ[env_variable]
    except KeyError:
        error_msg = 'Set the {} environment variable'.format(var_name)
        raise ImproperlyConfigured(error_msg)


SECRET_KEY = get_env_value('SECRET_KEY')
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': get_env_value('DATABASE_NAME'),
        'HOST': get_env_value('DATABASE_HOST'),
        'PORT': int(get_env_value('DATABASE_PORT')),
    }

```
`Pros`:
+ Configuration is separated from code.
+ Environment parity – you have the same code for all environments.
+ No inheritance in settings, and cleaner and more consistent code.
+ There is a theoretical grounding for using environment variables – 12 Factors.

`Cons`:
+ You need to handle sharing default config between developers.


## 12 Factors
12 Factors is a collection of recommendations on how to build distributed web-apps that will be easy to deploy and scale in the Cloud. It was created by Heroku, a well-known Cloud hosting provider.

As the name suggests, the collection consists of twelve parts:

I. Codebase
One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

II. Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

III. Config

Store config in the environment

IV. Backing services

Treat backing services as attached resources

V. Build, release, run

Strictly separate build and run stages

VI. Processes

Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

VII. Port binding

Export services via port binding

VIII. Concurrency

Scale out via the process model

IX. Disposability

Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

X. Dev/prod parity

Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

XI. Logs
Treat logs as event streams

XII. Admin processes

Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes


## django-environ
Based on the above, we see that environment variables are the perfect place to store settings.

Now it’s time to talk about the toolkit.

Writing code using os.environ could be tricky sometimes and require additional effort to handle errors. It’s better to use django-environ instead.

Technically it’s a merge of:

+ envparse
+ honcho
+ dj-database-url
+ dj-search-url
+ dj-config-url
+ django-cache-url



 This app gives a well-functioning API for reading values from environment 
variables or text files, handful type conversion, etc. Let’s look at some examples.

`settings.py` file before:
```
import os


SITE_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))))

DEBUG = True
TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'production_db',
        'USER': 'user',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'db.example.com',
        'PORT': '5432',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'sslmode': 'require'
        }
    }
}

MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, 'assets')
MEDIA_URL = 'media/'
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, 'static')
STATIC_URL = 'static/'

SECRET_KEY = 'Some-Autogenerated-Secret-Key'

CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django_redis.cache.RedisCache',
        'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:6379/1',
    }
}

```


`settings.py ``file after:
```
import environ


root = environ.Path(__file__) - 3  # get root of the project
env = environ.Env()
environ.Env.read_env()  # reading .env file

SITE_ROOT = root()

DEBUG = env.bool('DEBUG', default=False)
TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

DATABASES = {'default': env.db('DATABASE_URL')}

public_root = root.path('public/')
MEDIA_ROOT = public_root('media')
MEDIA_URL = env.str('MEDIA_URL', default='media/')
STATIC_ROOT = public_root('static')
STATIC_URL = env.str('STATIC_URL', default='static/')

SECRET_KEY = env.str('SECRET_KEY')

CACHES = {'default': env.cache('REDIS_CACHE_URL')}
```

`.env` file:
```
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db.example.com:5432/production_db?sslmode=require
REDIS_CACHE_URL=redis://user:password@cache.example.com:6379/1
SECRET_KEY=Some-Autogenerated-Secret-Key
```

## Setting Structure
Instead of splitting settings by environments, you can split them by the source: Django, third- party apps (Celery, DRF, etc.), and your custom settings.

`File structure:`
```
project/
├── apps/
├── settings/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── djano.py
│   ├── project.py
│   └── third_party.py
└── manage.py
```

`__init__.py` file:
```
from .django import *       # All Django related settings
from .third_party import *  # Celery, Django REST Framework & other 3rd parties
from .project import *      # You custom settings
```

Each module could be done as a package, and you can split it more granularly:
```
project/
├── apps/
├── settings/
│   ├── project
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── custom_module_foo.py
│   │   ├── custom_module_bar.py
│   │   └── custom_module_xyz.py
│   ├── third_party
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── celery.py
│   │   ├── email.py
│   │   └── rest_framework.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── djano.py
└── manage.py
```
## Django Settings: Best practices
+ Keep settings in environment variables.
+ Write default values for production configuration (excluding secret keys and tokens).
+ Don’t hardcode sensitive settings, and don’t put them in VCS.
+ Split settings into groups: Django, third-party, project.
+ Follow naming conventions for custom (project) settings.

# SSH

## What is SSH
SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet. The service was created as a secure replacement for the unencrypted Telnet and uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that all communication to and from the remote server happens in an encrypted manner. It provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client.


## How Does SSH Work 
For Mac and Linux users, head over to your terminal program and then follow the procedure below:

The SSH command consists of 3 distinct parts:

`ssh {user}@{host}`

The SSH key command instructs your system that you want to open an encrypted Secure Shell Connection.` {user}` represents the account you want to access. For example, you may want to access the root user, which is basically synonymous for system administrator with complete rights to modify anything on the system. `{host} `refers to the computer you want to access. This can be an IP Address (e.g. 244.235.23.19) or a domain name (e.g. www.xyzdomain.com).

When you hit enter, you will be prompted to enter the password for the requested account. When you type it in, nothing will appear on the screen, but your password is, in fact being transmitted. Once you’re done typing, hit enter once again. If your password is correct, you will be greeted with a remote terminal window.


## Encryption Techniques
The significant advantage offered by SSH over its predecessors is the use of encryption to ensure secure transfer of information between the host and the client. Host refers to the remote server you are trying to access, while the client is the computer you are using to access the host. There are three different encryption technologies used by SSH:

+ Symmetrical encryption
+ Asymmetrical encryption
+ Hashing.

### Symmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption is a form of encryption where a secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and the host. Effectively, any one possessing the key can decrypt the message being transferred.

 ### Asymmetric Encryption
Unlike symmetrical encryption, asymmetrical encryption uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption. These two keys are known as the public key and the private key. Together, both these keys form a public-private key pair.
![](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/asymmetric-encryption.webp)

 ### Hashing
One-way hashing is another form of cryptography used in Secure Shell Connections. One-way-hash functions differ from the above two forms of encryption in the sense that they are never meant to be decrypted. They generate a unique value of a fixed length for each input that shows no clear trend which can exploited. This makes them practically impossible to reverse. 
![](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/ssh-tutorial-hash.webp)

## How Does SSH Work with These Encryption Techniques
The way SSH works is by making use of a client-server model to allow for authentication of two remote systems and encryption of the data that passes between them.

SSH operates on TCP port 22 by default (though this can be changed if needed). The host (server) listens on port 22 (or any other SSH assigned port) for incoming connections. It organizes the secure connection by authenticating the client and opening the correct shell environment if the verification is successful. 
![](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/ssh-client-and-server.webp)


The client must begin the SSH connection by initiating the TCP handshake with the server, ensuring a secured symmetric connection, verifying whether the identity displayed by the server match previous records (typically recorded in an RSA key store file), and presenting the required user credentials to authenticate the connection.
