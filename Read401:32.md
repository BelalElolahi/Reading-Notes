# React 3 

### Create a Next.js App
o create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:
```
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"
```

Under the hood, this uses the tool called create-next-app, which bootstraps a Next.js app for you. It uses this template through the --example flag.

If it doesn’t work, please take a look at this page.


#### Run the development server
You now have a new directory called nextjs-blog. Let’s cd into it:

```
cd nextjs-blog
```

Then, run the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
This starts your Next.js app’s "development server" (more on this later) on port 3000.

### Editing the Page
Let’s try editing the starter page.

Make sure the Next.js development server is still running.
+ Open pages/index.js with your text editor.
+ Find the text that says “Welcome to” under the `<h1>` tag and change it to “Learn”.
+ Save the file.
As soon as you save the file, the browser automatically updates the page with the new text:
![](https://nextjs.org/static/images/learn/create-nextjs-app/learn-nextjs.png)

he Next.js development server has Fast Refresh enabled. When you make changes to files, Next.js automatically applies the changes in the browser almost instantly. No refresh needed! This will help you iterate on your app quickly.



### Create new page , Link the components
n Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a file in the `pages` directory.

Pages are associated with a route based on their file name. For example, in development:

+ `pages/index.js` is associated with the `/` route.
+ `pages/posts/first-post.js` is associated with the /posts/first-post route.
We already have the `pages/index.js` file, so let’s create `pages/posts/first-post.js` to see how it works.

Create a New Page
Create the posts directory under pages.

Create a file called first-post.js inside the posts directory with the following content:
```
export default function FirstPost() {
  return <h1>First Post</h1>
}
```
The component can have any name, but you must export it as a default export.


### Link the components
Using `<Link>` , 

First, open pages/index.js, and import the Link component from next/link by adding this line at the top:

import Link from 'next/link'
Then find the h1 tag that looks like this:
```
<h1 className="title">
  Learn <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js!</a>
</h1>

```
And change it to:
```
<h1 className="title">
  Read{' '}
  <Link href="/posts/first-post">
    <a>this page!</a>
  </Link>
</h1> 
```
{' '} adds an empty space, which is used to divide text over multiple lines.

Next, open pages/posts/first-post.js and replace its content with the following:
```
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Back to home</a>
        </Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Linking to dynamic paths
Defining routes by using predefined paths is not always enough for complex applications. In Next.js you can add brackets to a page ([param]) to create a dynamic route (a.k.a. url slugs, pretty urls, and others).

Consider the following page pages/post/[pid].js:

```
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

const Post = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { pid } = router.query

  return <p>Post: {pid}</p>
}
```
export default Post
Any route like /post/1, /post/abc, etc. will be matched by pages/post/[pid].js. The matched path parameter will be sent as a query parameter to the page, and it will be merged with the other query parameters.


You can also use interpolation to create the path, which comes in handy for dynamic route segments. For example, to show a list of posts which have been passed to the component as a prop:
```
import Link from 'next/link'

function Posts({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>
          <Link href={`/blog/${encodeURIComponent(post.slug)}`}>
            <a>{post.title}</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```
export default Posts
encodeURIComponent is used in the example to keep the path utf-8 compatible.

Alternatively, using a URL Object:
```
import Link from 'next/link'

function Posts({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>
          <Link
            href={{
              pathname: '/blog/[slug]',
              query: { slug: post.slug },
            }}
          >
            <a>{post.title}</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```
export default Posts
Now, instead of using interpolation to create the path, we use a URL object in href where:

pathname is the name of the page in the pages directory.` /blog/[slug]` in this case.

`query` is an object with the dynamic segment. slug in this case.

#### Caveats
Predefined routes take precedence over dynamic routes, and dynamic routes over catch all routes. Take a look at the following examples:

+ `pages/post/create.js` - Will` match /post/create`

+ `pages/post/[pid].js `- Will match `/post/1, /post/abc, etc.` But not` /post/create`

+ `pages/post/[...slug].js `- Will match `/post/1/2`, `/post/a/b/c, etc`. `But not /post/create, /post/abc`

Pages that are statically optimized by Automatic Static Optimization will be hydrated without their route parameters provided, i.e query will be an empty object ({}).

After hydration, Next.js will trigger an update to your application to provide the route parameters in the query object.

### Imperatively
Examples
next/link should be able to cover most of your routing needs, but you can also do client-side navigations without it, take a look at the documentation for next/router.

The following example shows how to do basic page navigations with useRouter:
```
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function ReadMore() {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <button onClick={() => router.push('/about')}>
      Click here to read more
    </button>
  )
}
```
### Shallow Routing 
Shallow routing allows you to change the URL without running data fetching methods again, that includes `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and `getInitialProps`.

You'll receive the updated `pathname` and the `query` via the `router` object (added by `useRouter` or `withRouter`), without losing state.

To enable `shallow` routing, set the shallow option to `true`. Consider the following example:

```
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

// Current URL is '/'
function Page() {
  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    // Always do navigations after the first render
    router.push('/?counter=10', undefined, { shallow: true })
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    // The counter changed!
  }, [router.query.counter])
}

export default Page

```

The URL will get updated to `/?counter=10`. and the page won't get replaced, only the state of the route is changed.

You can also watch for URL changes via `componentDidUpdate` as shown below:
```
componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
  const { pathname, query } = this.props.router
  // verify props have changed to avoid an infinite loop
  if (query.counter !== prevProps.router.query.counter) {
    // fetch data based on the new query
  }
}
```

#### Caveats
Shallow routing only works for same page URL changes. For example, let's assume we have another page called pages/about.js, and you run this:
```
router.push('/?counter=10', '/about?counter=10', { shallow: true })
```
Since that's a new page, it'll unload the current page, load the new one and wait for data fetching even though we asked to do shallow routing.


## React Context 
React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props.


### When should you use React context?
React context is great when you are passing data that can be used in any component in your application.

These types of data include:

Theme data (like dark or light mode)
User data (the currently authenticated user)
Location-specific data (like user language or locale)
Data should be placed on React context that does not need to be updated often.

Why? Because context was not made as an entire state management system. It was made to make consuming data easier.

You can think of React context as the equivalent of global variables for our React components.

### What problems does React context solve?
React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling.

Props drilling is a term to describe when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it.

Here is an example of props drilling. In this application, we have access to theme data that we want to pass as a prop to all of our app's components.

As you can see, however, the direct children of App, such as Header, also have to pass the theme data down using props.

### How do I use React context?
Context is an API that is built into React, starting from React version 16.

This means that we can create and use context directly by importing React in any React project.

There are four steps to using React context:

+ Create context using the createContext method.
+ Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree.
+ Put any value you like on your context provider using the value prop.
+ Read that value within any component by using the context consumer.

```
import React from 'react';

export const UserContext = React.createContext();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value="Reed">
      <User />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  )
}

function User() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Consumer>
      {value => <h1>{value}</h1>} 
      {/* prints: Reed */}
    </UserContext.Consumer>
  )
}
```

### What is the useContext hook?

```
import React from 'react';

export const UserContext = React.createContext();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value="Reed">
      <User />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  )
}

function User() {
  const value = React.useContext(UserContext);  
    
  return <h1>{value}</h1>;
}
```
