# Cryptography 
Cryptography, or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior.

## Encryption, decryption, and cracking
### Encrypting a message
Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:
SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE
Here's what that might look like encrypted:
YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK
That looks an awfully lot like gobbledygook at first, but this encrypted message is actually very related to the original text.
The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.
To make the encrypted message above, I shifted the alphabet by 6 and used this substitution table:
```
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	A	B	C	D	E	F
```
S shifts 6 letters over to Y, E shifts 6 letters over to K, etc. Here's the first word and its shifts:
```
S	E	C	R	E	T
Y	K	I	X	K	Z
```
### Decrypting a message
According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message.
Imagine Caesar sends this message to a comrade:
EHZDUH EUXWXV
The comrade uses this substitution table, where the alphabet is shifted by 3:
```
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	A	B	C
```
They can then decode the message with certainty. The first letter "E" was shifted by 3 from "B", the second letter "H" was shifted by 3 from "E", etc. The result is this ominous message:
```
BEWARE BRUTUS
```

### Cracking the cipher
Imagine that a very literate and savvy enemy intercepts one of Caesar's messages.
```
RZ VMZ WMDIBDIB VGG AJMXZN OJ EJDI RDOC XGZJKVOMV OJ YZAZVO OCZ ZIZHT LPZZI VO OCZ IDGZ YZGOV
```
That enemy does not know that Caesar always uses a shift of 3, so he must attempt to "crack" the cipher without knowing the shift.
There are three main techniques he could use: frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force.


## Caesar cipher
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.[1]

The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communications security.


The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):
```
Plain	A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
Cipher	X	Y	Z	A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W
```
When encrypting, a person looks up each letter of the message in the "plain" line and writes down the corresponding letter in the "cipher" line.
```
Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
```
Deciphering is done in reverse, with a right shift of 3.

The encryption can also be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the scheme, A → 0, B → 1, ..., Z → 25. Encryption of a letter x by a shift n can be described mathematically as,

`En(x)=(x+n)\mod 26`

Decryption is performed similarly,

`Dn(x)=(x-n)\mod 26`

(There are different definitions for the modulo operation. In the above, the result is in the range 0 to 25; i.e., if x + n or x − n are not in the range 0 to 25, we have to subtract or add 26.)

The replacement remains the same throughout the message, so the cipher is classed as a type of monoalphabetic substitution, as opposed to polyalphabetic substitution.
