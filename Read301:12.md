# CRUD
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)Permalink
The CRUD model defines the most basic API actions for persistent storage. Create, read, update, and delete. They make up the lions-share of API endpoints. Let’s see which status codes meet their requirements.



**100’s** = they usually tell the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client.
**200’s** = These are the success codes.
**300’s** =These are redirection codes. They tell the client that the resource they are requesting isn’t available at the expected location anymore
**400’s** = These are the client error codes. They are all about invalid requests a client sent to a server. There are several causes to this, timeouts, wrong URI, missing authentication, 

**500’s** = means Internal Server Error, which can be anything from a missing header field the backend accessed without checking its existence to an unreachable third party service the backend wanted to call.

### What is a status code 202?
Accepted - Often used for asynchronous processing. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future. The response body should include an URL to the finished resource with some information about when it will be available, or an URL to some monitoring endpoint that tells the client when the resource is available.

### What is a status code 308?
Permanent Redirect - This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore. It’s helpful when we have multiple endpoints for one resource, but don’t want to implement reading from all of them.
#### What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?
 204 No Content
#### What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does? 
409 Conflict
#### What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.
