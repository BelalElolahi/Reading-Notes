# Django Models
## Models
A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

The basics:

+ Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.
+ Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
+ With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API .


This example model defines a Person, which has a first_name and last_name:
```
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)

```    

The above Person model would create a database table like this:
```
CREATE TABLE myapp_person (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "first_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "last_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
);
```

### Model definition
Models are usually defined in an application's models.py file. They are implemented as subclasses of django.db.models.Model, and can include fields, methods and metadata. The code fragment below shows a "typical" model, named MyModelName:
```
from django.db import models

class MyModelName(models.Model):
    """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

    # Fields
    my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
    ...

    # Metadata
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-my_field_name']

    # Methods
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the url to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
        return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
        return self.my_field_name
```


## Fields
A model can have an arbitrary number of fields, of any type — each one represents a column of data that we want to store in one of our database tables. Each database record (row) will consist of one of each field value. Let's look at the example seen below:
```
my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
```


Common field arguments
The following common arguments can be used when declaring many/most of the different field types:

`help_text`: Provides a text label for HTML forms (e.g. in the admin site), as described above.

`verbose_name`: A human-readable name for the field used in field labels. If not specified, Django will infer the default verbose name from the field name.

`default`: The default value for the field. This can be a value or a callable object, in which case the object will be called every time a new record is created.

`null`: If True, Django will store blank values as NULL in the database for fields where this is appropriate (a CharField will instead store an empty string). The default is False.

`blank`: If True, the field is allowed to be blank in your forms. The default is False, which means that Django's form validation will force you to enter a value. This is often used with null=True , because if you're going to allow blank values, you also want the database to be able to represent them appropriately.

`choices`: A group of choices for this field. If this is provided, the default corresponding form widget will be a select box with these choices instead of the standard text field.

`primary_key`: If True, sets the current field as the primary key for the model (A primary key is a special database column designated to uniquely identify all the different table records). If no field is specified as the primary key then Django will automatically add a field for this purpose.
## Methods

Minimally, in every model you should define the standard Python class method __str__() to return a human-readable string for each object. This string is used to represent individual records in the administration site (and anywhere else you need to refer to a model instance). Often this will return a title or name field from the model.

```
def __str__(self):
    return self.field_name
```

Another common method to include in Django models is get_absolute_url(), which returns a URL for displaying individual model records on the website (if you define this method then Django will automatically add a "View on Site" button to the model's record editing screens in the Admin site). A typical pattern for get_absolute_url() is shown below.


```
def get_absolute_url(self):
    """Returns the url to access a particular instance of the model."""
    return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

```

## Model management

### Creating and modifying records
To create a record you can define an instance of the model and then call save().

```
# Create a new record using the model's constructor.
record = MyModelName(my_field_name="Instance #1")

# Save the object into the database.
record.save()
```

```
# Access model field values using Python attributes.
print(record.id) # should return 1 for the first record.
print(record.my_field_name) # should print 'Instance #1'

# Change record by modifying the fields, then calling save().
record.my_field_name = "New Instance Name"
record.save()
```

### Searching for records
You can search for records that match certain criteria using the model's objects attribute (provided by the base class).

```
all_books = Book.objects.all()

```


```
wild_books = Book.objects.filter(title__contains='wild')
number_wild_books = wild_books.count()
```

```
# Will match on: Fiction, Science fiction, non-fiction etc.
books_containing_genre = Book.objects.filter(genre__name__icontains='fiction')

```


### Don't forget that after a change to your model, you should again re-run your database migrations to add the changes.
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
