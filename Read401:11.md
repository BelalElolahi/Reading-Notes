#  Data Analysis 

## JupyterLab 
is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing, for example:

+ Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.

+ Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.

+ Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.

+ Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.

JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats. See File and Output Formats for more information.

To navigate the user interface, JupyterLab offers customizable keyboard shortcuts and the ability to use key maps from vim, emacs, and Sublime Text in the text editor.

JupyterLab extensions can customize or enhance any part of JupyterLab, including new themes, file editors, and custom components.

JupyterLab is served from the same server and uses the same notebook document format as the classic Jupyter Notebook.

###  JupyterLab 
Since JupyterLab 0.32 (February 2018), the releases of JupyterLab are suitable for general daily use by both Jupyter novices and users experienced with the Classic Notebook interface. As of the 1.0 release (June 2019), it is additionally ready for extension writers who wish to further customize the JupyterLab experience for others. Please review the Changelog for detailed descriptions of each release.

The extension developer API is evolving, and we also are currently iterating on UI/UX improvements. We appreciate feedback on our GitHub issues page as we evolve towards a stable extension development API.

JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook. Throughout this transition, the same notebook document format will be supported by both the classic Notebook and JupyterLab.




##  NumPy Tutorial: Data Analysis with Python

NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood. NumPy was originally developed in the mid 2000s, and arose from an even older package called Numeric. This longevity means that almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python leverages NumPy in some way.

### Lists Of Lists for CSV Data
Before using NumPy, we’ll first try to work with the data using Python and the csv package. We can read in the file using the csv.reader object, which will allow us to read in and split up all the content from the ssv file.

```
import csv
with open('winequality-red.csv', 'r') as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=';'))
 print(wines[:3])
 
```

### Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays
With NumPy, we work with multidimensional arrays. We’ll dive into all of the possible types of multidimensional arrays later on, but for now, we’ll focus on 2-dimensional arrays. A 2-dimensional array is also known as a matrix, and is something you should be familiar with. In fact, it’s just a different way of thinking about a list of lists. A matrix has rows and columns. By specifying a row number and a column number, we’re able to extract an element from a matrix.

```
import csv
with open("winequality-red.csv", 'r') as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=";"))
import numpy as np
wines = np.array(wines[1:], dtype=np.float)
```

###Using NumPy To Read In Files
It’s possible to use NumPy to directly read csv or other files into arrays. We can do this using the numpy.genfromtxt function. We can use it to read in our initial data on red wines. 
```
wines = np.genfromtxt("winequality-red.csv", delimiter=";", skip_header=1)

```
### Indexing NumPy Arrays
We now know how to create arrays, but unless we can retrieve results from them, there isn’t a lot we can do with NumPy. We can use array indexing to select individual elements, groups of elements, or entire rows and columns. One important thing to keep in mind is that just like Python lists, NumPy is zero-indexed, meaning that the index of the first row is 0, and the index of the first column is 0. If we want to work with the fourth row, we’d use index 3, if we want to work with the second row, we’d use index 1, and so on. We’ll again work with the wines array:
```
wines[2,3]
```

### Slicing NumPy Arrays
If we instead want to select the first three items from the fourth column, we can do it using a colon (:). A colon indicates that we want to select all the elements from the starting index up to but not including the ending index. This is also known as a slice:
```
wines[0:3,3]

```

### NumPy Data Types
As we mentioned earlier, each NumPy array can store elements of a single data type. For example, wines contains only float values. NumPy stores values using its own data types, which are distinct from Python types like float and str. This is because the core of NumPy is written in a programming language called C, which stores data differently than the Python data types. NumPy data types map between Python and C, allowing us to use NumPy arrays without any conversion hitches.

You can find the data type of a NumPy array by accessing the dtype property:
+ float — numeric 
+ floating point data.

+ int — integer data.

+ string — character data.

+ object — Python objects.

### NumPy Array Operations
NumPy makes it simple to perform mathematical operations on arrays. This is one of the primary advantages of NumPy, and makes it quite easy to do computations.

#### Single Array Math
If you do any of the basic mathematical operations (/, *, -, +, ^) with an array and a value, it will apply the operation to each of the elements in the array.
#### Multiple Array Math
It’s also possible to do mathematical operations between arrays. This will apply the operation to pairs of elements. For example, if we add the quality column to itself, here’s what we get:
```
wines[:,10] * wines[:,11]

```


### Broadcasting
Unless the arrays that you’re operating on are the exact same size, it’s not possible to do elementwise operations. In cases like this, NumPy performs broadcasting to try to match up elements. Essentially, broadcasting involves a few steps:

+ The last dimension of each array is compared.
  + If the dimension lengths are equal, or one of the dimensions is of length 1, then we keep going.
  + If the dimension lengths aren’t equal, and none of the dimensions have length 1, then there’s an error.
+ Continue checking dimensions until the shortest array is out of dimensions.


### __________________________________________________
NumPy is the basic library for mathematical operations in Machine Learning. It has a vast range of functions to manipulate arrays and matrices. It is a very convenient and user-friendly library. It has made to work with an array element a much easier task.

Working with arrays has turned out to be a much faster and time-efficient process. It is very easy to install and implement.

There are many modules in NumPy that are specific to various complex functions. It can also extend functionalities by combining with other python libraries.
