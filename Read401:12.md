# Pandas 
pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.

## Main Featuers
Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:

+ Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN, NA, or NaT) in floating point as well as non-floating point data
+ Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects
+ Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations
+ Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data
+ Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects
+ Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets
+ Intuitive merging and joining data sets
+ Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
+ Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)
+ Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format
+ Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging

#### Getting started
To use pandas, you'll typically start with the following line of code.
```
import pandas as pd
```


### Object creation
See the Data Structure Intro section.

Creating a Series by passing a list of values, letting pandas create a default integer index:
```
in [3]: s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8])

in [3] s :
Out[4]: 
0    1.0
1    3.0
2    5.0
3    NaN
4    6.0
5    8.0
dtype: float64
```
#### Viewing data
See the Basics section.

Here is how to view the top and bottom rows of the frame:
```
df.head()
Out[13]: 
                   A         B         C         D
2013-01-01  0.469112 -0.282863 -1.509059 -1.135632
2013-01-02  1.212112 -0.173215  0.119209 -1.044236
2013-01-03 -0.861849 -2.104569 -0.494929  1.071804
2013-01-04  0.721555 -0.706771 -1.039575  0.271860
2013-01-05 -0.424972  0.567020  0.276232 -1.087401

df.tail(3)
Out[14]: 
                   A         B         C         D
2013-01-04  0.721555 -0.706771 -1.039575  0.271860
2013-01-05 -0.424972  0.567020  0.276232 -1.087401
2013-01-06 -0.673690  0.113648 -1.478427  0.524988
```

#### Missing data
pandas primarily uses the value np.nan to represent missing data. It is by default not included in computations. See the Missing Data section.

Reindexing allows you to change/add/delete the index on a specified axis. This returns a copy of the data.
```
df1 = df.reindex(index=dates[0:4], columns=list(df.columns) + ["E"])

df1.loc[dates[0] : dates[1], "E"] = 1

df1
Out[57]: 
                   A         B         C  D    F    E
2013-01-01  0.000000  0.000000 -1.509059  5  NaN  1.0
2013-01-02  1.212112 -0.173215  0.119209  5  1.0  1.0
2013-01-03 -0.861849 -2.104569 -0.494929  5  2.0  NaN
2013-01-04  0.721555 -0.706771 -1.039575  5  3.0  NaN
```

#### Grouping
By “group by” we are referring to a process involving one or more of the following steps:

Splitting the data into groups based on some criteria

Applying a function to each group independently

Combining the results into a data structure

See the Grouping section.
```
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "A": ["foo", "bar", "foo", "bar", "foo", "bar", "foo", "foo"],
        "B": ["one", "one", "two", "three", "two", "two", "one", "three"],
        "C": np.random.randn(8),
        "D": np.random.randn(8),
    }
)


df
Out[88]: 
     A      B         C         D
0  foo    one  1.346061 -1.577585
1  bar    one  1.511763  0.396823
2  foo    two  1.627081 -0.105381
3  bar  three -0.990582 -0.532532
4  foo    two -0.441652  1.453749
5  bar    two  1.211526  1.208843
6  foo    one  0.268520 -0.080952
7  foo  three  0.024580 -0.264610
```

#### Reshaping
See the sections on Hierarchical Indexing and Reshaping.
```
Stack
tuples = list(
    zip(
        *[
            ["bar", "bar", "baz", "baz", "foo", "foo", "qux", "qux"],
            ["one", "two", "one", "two", "one", "two", "one", "two"],
        ]
    )
)


index = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples(tuples, names=["first", "second"])

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(8, 2), index=index, columns=["A", "B"])

df2 = df[:4]

df2
Out[95]: 
                     A         B
first second                    
bar   one    -0.727965 -0.589346
      two     0.339969 -0.693205
baz   one    -0.339355  0.593616
      two     0.884345  1.591431
```

#### Time series
pandas has simple, powerful, and efficient functionality for performing resampling operations during frequency conversion (e.g., converting secondly data into 5-minutely data). This is extremely common in, but not limited to, financial applications. See the Time Series section.
```
rng = pd.date_range("1/1/2012", periods=100, freq="S")

ts = pd.Series(np.random.randint(0, 500, len(rng)), index=rng)

ts.resample("5Min").sum()
Out[106]: 
2012-01-01    24182
Freq: 5T, dtype: int64 
```

![](Categoricals
pandas can include categorical data in a DataFrame. For full docs, see the categorical introduction and the API documentation.
```
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {"id": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "raw_grade": ["a", "b", "b", "a", "a", "e"]}
)
)
```
#### Plotting
See the Plotting docs.

We use the standard convention for referencing the matplotlib API:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.close("all")
The close() method is used to close a figure window.

ts = pd.Series(np.random.randn(1000), index=pd.date_range("1/1/2000", periods=1000))

ts = ts.cumsum()

ts.plot();
```
#### Getting data in/out
+ HDF5
Reading and writing to HDFStores.

Writing to a HDF5 Store.
```
df.to_hdf("foo.h5", "df")
```
+ Excel
Reading and writing to MS Excel.

Writing to an excel file.
```
df.to_excel("foo.xlsx", sheet_name="Sheet1")
```
+ Gotchas
If you are attempting to perform an operation you might see an exception like:
```
if pd.Series([False, True, False]):
    print("I was true")
Traceback
    ...
ValueError: The truth value of an array is ambiguous. Use a.empty, a.any
```
