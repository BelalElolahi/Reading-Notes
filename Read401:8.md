## List Comprehensions in Python 

Chances are you’ll use a lot of lists as a Python programmer. While we’re all big fans of for loops (and nested for loops), Python provides a more concise method for handling lists and list comprehension. 

In order to keep your code elegant and readable, it’s recommended that you use Python’s comprehension features.

List comprehension is a powerful and concise method for creating lists in Python that becomes essential the more you work with lists, and lists of lists.

#### Create a List with range()
Let’s start by creating a list of numbers using Python list comprehensions. We’ll take advantage of Python’s range() method as a way to create a list of digits.

Example 1: Creating a list with list comprehensions

 >>
 [ expression for item in list ]
 
 >>digits = [x for x in range(10)]

>> print(digits)
>> Output

>> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  


### Create a List Using Loops and List Comprehension in Python
To better illustrate how a list comprehension can be used to write more efficient Python code, we’ll take a look at a side by side comparison. 

In the following example, you’ll see two different techniques for creating a Python list. The first is a for loop. We’ll use it to construct a list of the powers of two.

Example 2: Comparing list creation methods in Python

First, create a list and loop through it. Add an expression, in this example, we’ll raise x to the power of 2.

 create a list using a for loop
>> squares = [] 
>> for x in range(10):
   >>  raise x to the power of 2
   >> squares.append(x**2)

>> print(squares)
>> [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]


#### Multiplying Parts of a List
What if we wanted to multiply every number in a list by three in Python? We could write a for loop and store the results in a new list, or we could use list comprehensions.


create a list with list comprehensions
>>> multiples_of_three = [ x*3 for x in range(10) ]

>>> print(multiples_of_three)
>>> Output

>>> [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27]


#### Using functions in list comprehensions
So far we’ve seen how to use list comprehension to generate lists using some basic Python methods like lower() and upper(). But what if we wanted to use our own Python functions?

Not only can we write our own functions with list comprehensions, but we can also add filters to better control the statements.


list comprehension with functions
create a function that returns a number doubled
>> def double(x):
   
   >>return x*2

>>nums = [double(x) for x in range(1,10)]

>>print(nums)

>>Output

>>[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
