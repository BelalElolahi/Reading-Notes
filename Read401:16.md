#  Machine Learning Intro 
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Generally speaking, we can break down applied machine learning into the following chunks:




`Exploratory Analysis`

First, "get to know" the data. This step should be quick, efficient, and decisive.


``Data Cleaning``

Then, clean your data to avoid many common pitfalls. Better data beats fancier algorithms.


`Feature Engineering`

Next, help your algorithms "focus" on what's important by creating new features.


`Algorithm Selection`

Choose the best, most appropriate algorithms without wasting your time.


`Model Training`

Finally, train your models. This step is pretty formulaic once you've done the first 4.

` `

### there are other situational steps as well:

`Project Scoping`

Sometimes, you'll need to roadmap the project and anticipate data needs.


`Data Wrangling`

You may also need to restructure your dataset into a format that algorithms can handle.


`Preprocessing`

Often, transforming your features first can further improve performance.


`Ensembling`

You can squeeze out even more performance by combining multiple models.

##  Exploratory Analysis 


The purpose of exploratory analysis is to "get to know" the dataset. Doing so upfront will make the rest of the project much smoother, in 3 main ways:

You’ll gain valuable hints for Data Cleaning (which can make or break your models).
You’ll think of ideas for Feature Engineering (which can take your models from good to great).
You’ll get a "feel" for the dataset, which will help you communicate results and deliver greater impact.
However, exploratory analysis for machine learning should be quick, efficient, and decisive... not long and drawn out!

Don’t skip this step, but don’t get stuck on it either.

You see, there are infinite possible plots, charts, and tables, but you only need a handful to "get to know" the data well enough to work with it.

In this lesson, we'll show you the visualizations that provide the biggest bang for your buck.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is one those things that everyone does but no one really talks about. Sure, it’s not the "sexiest" part of machine learning. And no, there aren’t hidden tricks and secrets to uncover.

However, proper data cleaning can make or break your project. Professional data scientists usually spend a very large portion of their time on this step.

Why? Because of a simple truth in machine learning:

Better data beats fancier algorithms.


##  Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is about creating new input features from your existing ones.

In general, you can think of data cleaning as a process of subtraction and feature engineering as a process of addition.

This is often one of the most valuable tasks a data scientist can do to improve model performance, for 3 big reasons:

You can isolate and highlight key information, which helps your algorithms "focus" on what’s important.
You can bring in your own domain expertise.
Most importantly, once you understand the "vocabulary" of feature engineering, you can bring in other people’s domain expertise!
In this lesson, we will introduce several heuristics to help spark new ideas.

Before moving on, we just want to note that this is not an exhaustive compendium of all feature engineering because there are limitless possibilities for this step.

The good news is that this skill will naturally improve as you gain more experience.

## Algorithm Selection
First, we must clear up one of the biggest misconceptions about machine learning:

Machine learning is not about algorithms.

When you open a textbook or a university syllabus, you'll often be greeted by a grocery list of algorithms.

This has fueled the misconception that machine learning is about mastering dozens of algorithms. However, it's much more than that...

Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to solving problems...

...and individual algorithms are only one piece of the puzzle. The rest of the puzzle is how you apply them the right way.

## Model Training 

At last, it’s time to build our models!

It might seem like it took us a while to get here, but professional data scientists actually spend the bulk of their time on the steps leading up to this one:

+ Exploring the data.

+ Cleaning the data.

+ Engineering new features.

Again, that’s because better data beats fancier algorithms.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to set up the entire modeling process to maximize performance while safeguarding against overfitting. We will swap algorithms in and out and automatically find the best parameters for each one.
