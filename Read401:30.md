# React

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

#### Declarative
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.


#### Component-Based
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.



#### Learn Once, Write Anywhere
We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.


## Hello World
The smallest React example looks like this:
```
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```



## Introducing JSX


### Why JSX?
React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.

React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.


In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:
```
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```


In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, formatName(user), into an `<h1>` element.

```
function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### JSX is an Expression Too
After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:
```
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}

```

### Specifying Attributes with JSX
You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:

```
const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;
```
You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:

```
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
```
Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.




### Specifying Children with JSX
If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with />, like XML:

```
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />;
```
JSX tags may contain children:
```
const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
  </div>
);
```

### JSX Prevents Injection Attacks
It is safe to embed user input in JSX:
```
const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;

// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;

```
By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.

### JSX Represents Objects
Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.

These two examples are identical:
```
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);

```

```
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```
React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:
```
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};

```


## Rendering Elements
### Rendering an Element into the DOM
Let’s say there is a <div> somewhere in your HTML file:

```
<div id="root"></div>
```
We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():
```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```
It displays “Hello, world” on the page.

### Updating the Rendered Element
React elements are `immutable`. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to` ReactDOM.render()`.

Consider this ticking clock example:
```
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```
It calls `ReactDOM.render()` every second from a `setInterval()` callback.



## Components and Props 

React components implement a render() method that takes input data and returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render() via this.props.

```
class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Hello {this.props.name}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloMessage name="Taylor" />,
  document.getElementById('hello-example')
);
```


#### Props are Read-Only
Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:
```
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:
```
function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}
```
React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:

All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.


## State 
State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component’s current situation.
It’s managed in the component (just like any variable declared in a function).

### State Updates May Be Asynchronous
React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance.

Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

For example, this code may fail to update the counter:
```
// Wrong
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
});


```

To fix it, use a second form of setState() that accepts a function rather than an object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument:
```
// Correct
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
```

We used an arrow function above, but it also works with regular functions:
```

// Correct
this.setState(function(state, props) {
  return {
    counter: state.counter + props.increment
  };
});
```

### State Updates are Merged
When you call setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.

For example, your state may contain several independent variables:
```
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      posts: [],
      comments: []
    };
  }

```
Then you can update them independently with separate setState() calls:
```
  componentDidMount() {
    fetchPosts().then(response => {
      this.setState({
        posts: response.posts
      });
    });

    fetchComments().then(response => {
      this.setState({
        comments: response.comments
      });
    });
  }
  ```
The merging is shallow, so this.setState({comments}) leaves this.state.posts intact, but completely replaces this.state.comments.


## The Data Flows Down
Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they shouldn’t care whether it is defined as a function or a class.

This is why state is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it. 

## Handling Events
Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
For example :
```
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```


```
function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('You clicked submit.');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```


When using React, you generally don’t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

When you define a component using an ES6 class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class. For example, this Toggle component renders a button that lets the user toggle between “ON” and “OFF” states:
```
class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {isToggleOn: true};

    // This binding is necessary to make `this` work in the callback
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      isToggleOn: !prevState.isToggleOn
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        {this.state.isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
      </button>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Toggle />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

```


This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally, if you refer to a method without () after it, such as `onClick={this.handleClick}`, you should bind that method.

If calling bind annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental public class fields syntax, you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks:

```
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick.
  // Warning: this is *experimental* syntax.
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
This syntax is enabled by default in Create React App.

```

If you aren’t using class fields syntax, you can use an arrow function in the callback:
```
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

## Passing Arguments to Event Handlers
Inside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if id is the row ID, either of the following would work:

```
<button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>

```

```
<button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}>Delete Row</button>

```
The above two lines are equivalent, and use arrow functions and Function.prototype.bind respectively.

In both cases, the e argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with bind any further arguments are automatically forwarded.
