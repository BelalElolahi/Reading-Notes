## Linear Regressions


## What Is Regression?
Regression searches for relationships among variables.

For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on the features, such as experience, level of education, role, city they work in, and so on.

This is a regression problem where data related to each employee represent one observation. The presumption is that the experience, education, role, and city are the independent features, while the salary depends on them.

Similarly, you can try to establish a mathematical dependence of the prices of houses on their areas, numbers of bedrooms, distances to the city center, and so on.

Generally, in regression analysis, you usually consider some phenomenon of interest and have a number of observations. Each observation has two or more features. Following the assumption that (at least) one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish a relation among them.

## When Do You Need Regression?
Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent the experience or gender impact salaries.

Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. For example, you could try to predict electricity consumption of a household for the next hour given the outdoor temperature, time of day, and number of residents in that household.

Regression is used in many different fields: economy, computer science, social sciences, and so on. Its importance rises every day with the availability of large amounts of data and increased awareness of the practical value of data.
### Linear Regressions
Linear regression is one of the fundamental statistical and machine learning techniques. Whether you want to do statistics, machine learning, or scientific computing, there are good chances that you’ll need it. It’s advisable to learn it first and then proceed towards more complex methods.

## Implementing Linear Regression in Python
It’s time to start implementing linear regression in Python. Basically, all you should do is apply the proper packages and their functions and classes.

Python Packages for Linear Regression
The package NumPy is a fundamental Python scientific package that allows many high-performance operations on single- and multi-dimensional arrays. It also offers many mathematical routines. Of course, it’s open source.

If you’re not familiar with NumPy, you can use the official NumPy User Guide and read Look Ma, No For-Loops: Array Programming With NumPy. In addition, Pure Python vs NumPy vs TensorFlow Performance Comparison can give you a pretty good idea on the performance gains you can achieve when applying NumPy.

The package scikit-learn is a widely used Python library for machine learning, built on top of NumPy and some other packages. It provides the means for preprocessing data, reducing dimensionality, implementing regression, classification, clustering, and more. Like NumPy, scikit-learn is also open source.

You can check the page Generalized Linear Models on the scikit-learn web site to learn more about linear models and get deeper insight into how this package works.

If you want to implement linear regression and need the functionality beyond the scope of scikit-learn, you should consider statsmodels. It’s a powerful Python package for the estimation of statistical models, performing tests, and more. It’s open source as well.


### Simple Linear Regression With scikit-learn
Let’s start with the simplest case, which is simple linear regression.

There are five basic steps when you’re implementing linear regression:

+ Import the packages and classes you need.
+ Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate 
 transformations.
+ Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.
+ Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.
+ Apply the model for predictions.

```
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

>>> X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3]])
>>> # y = 1 * x_0 + 2 * x_1 + 3
>>> y = np.dot(X, np.array([1, 2])) + 3
>>> reg = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
>>> reg.score(X, y)
1.0
>>> reg.coef_
array([1., 2.])
>>> reg.intercept_
3.0...
>>> reg.predict(np.array([[3, 5]]))
array([16.])
```
#### Methods
```
fit(X, y[, sample_weight])

Fit linear model.

get_params([deep])

Get parameters for this estimator.

predict(X)

Predict using the linear model.

score(X, y[, sample_weight])

Return the coefficient of determination of the prediction.

set_params(**params)

Set the parameters of this estimator.
```




## Conclusion
You now know what linear regression is and how you can implement it with Python and three open-source packages: NumPy, scikit-learn, and statsmodels.

You use NumPy for handling arrays.

Linear regression is implemented with the following:

1-  scikit-learn if you don’t need detailed results and want to use - 
 - the approach consistent with other regression techniques
 - statsmodels if you need the advanced statistical parameters of a model
 -  Both approaches are worth learning how to use and exploring - 

 - further. The links in this article can be very useful for that.

When performing linear regression in Python, you can follow these steps:

+ Import the packages and classes you need
+ Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate 
transformations
+ Create a regression model and fit it with existing data
+ Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory
