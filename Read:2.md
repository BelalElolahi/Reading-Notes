# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions
## HTML Text
Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs
#### Headings

That used for Tiltel  and below u can see the example:

#### Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
Line Breaks to add line space

Horizontal Rules
To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the **<**hr /**>** tag

#### Semantic Markup 
Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on

## CSS Introduction 
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

### css syntax :

how to write Css ?
Css write in three way like the picture below

### css selectors: 
In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style. In this article and its sub-articles we'll run through the different types in great detail, seeing how they work.

Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like). Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

## Basic JavaScript Instructions
JavaScript like other laguages you have an  instructions to folw them
and script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe. 


#### variable and how to declarate them

 #### Data type 
 Data type is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret its value. Understanding data types ensures that data is collected in the preferred format and the value of each property is as expected.

 #### arrays 
 An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

##### let car1 = "Saab";
##### let car2 = "Volvo";
##### let car3 = "BMW";
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

syntax of array :

#### EXPRESSIONS and OPERATORS

#### Decisions and Loops 
Decisions

A normal program is not a sequential execution of expressions or statements one after the other. It will have certain conditions to be checked or it will have certain number of iterations. When we check for certain conditions to execute further then it called as decision statements. If the condition in decision statements are true then one set of instructions are executed, if false then another set of instructions are executed. This kind of decision is cannot be done using conditional operator. That will be mainly used to return single line of action / result. When we have to perform series of operation, we use IF conditions.

Loops 

Loops
The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using **for**, **while**, **do while** or **for-in loops**. It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.

There are loops in JavaScript.

- for loop
- while loop
- do-while loop
- for-in loop
#### 1) JavaScript For loop
The JavaScript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is known. The syntax of for loop is given below:

#### 2) JavaScript while loop
The JavaScript while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is not known. The syntax of while loop is given below.
![](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/ecampus-video/CS161/template/chapter_5/chapter5_images/5_01.png)

 #### 3) JavaScript do while loop
The JavaScript do while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times like while loop. But, code is executed at least once whether condition is true or false. The syntax of do while loop is given below.
