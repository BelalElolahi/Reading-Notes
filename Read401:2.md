# Testing and Modules 
#### Unit tests 
are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

#### TDD 
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a methodology in software development that focuses on an iterative development cycle where the emphasis is placed on writing test cases before the actual feature or function is written. TDD utilizes repetition of short development cycles. It combines building and testing. This process not only helps ensure correctness of the code -- but also helps to indirectly evolve the design and architecture of the project at hand.

TDD usually follows the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle:

+ Add a test to the test suite
+ (Red) Run all the tests to ensure the new test fails
+ (Green) Write just enough code to get that single test to pass
+ Run all tests
+ (Refactor) Improve the initial code while keeping the tests green
Repeat

Other thing to care about is the structure. A convention widely used is the AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.
Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.
Now you can execute the tests. I suggest the lib pytest to do it. But you are free to choose anything you like.



### What does the if __name__ == “__main__”: do?
Before executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables. 
If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable. 

######  print ("Always executed")
  
######  if __name__ == "__main__":
######     print ("Executed when invoked directly")
######  else:
 ######    print ("Executed when imported")

##### Modules :
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. 

##### Advantages : 

Every Python module has it’s __name__ defined and if this is ‘__main__’, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.
If you import this script as a module in another script, the __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.
Python files can act as either reusable modules, or as standalone programs.
if __name__ == “main”: is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported.

## Recursion 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.

#### code Example :
Let us consider a problem that a programmer have to determine the sum of first n natural numbers, there are several ways of doing that but the simplest approach is simply add the numbers starting from 1 to n. So the function simply looks like,



approach(1) – Simply adding one by one

f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 +……..+ n

but there is another mathematical approach of representing this,

approach(2) – Recursive adding 

f(n) = 1                  n=1

f(n) = n + f(n-1)    n>1

There is a simple difference between the approach (1) and approach(2) and that is in approach(2) the function “ f( ) ” itself is being called inside the function, so this phenomenon is named as recursion and the function containing recursion is called recursive function, at the end this is a great tool in the hand of the programmers to code some problems in a lot easier and efficient way.
