# NODE.JS  

## What Is Node.js? 
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, one way dataflow ,asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library 

###  Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine 
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

#### what is that mean JavaScript runtime
Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. how to konw node version:
 
node -v  
v14.17.3

npm
node packge manager .

To check which version you have installed on your system, type npm -v.
npm -v

6.14.13

###### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

Installing a Package 
Open your terminal and type the following:

npm install -g jshint

#### What is node used for?

Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

##  pair programming

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

### which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
 I find these reasons are the most useful because they strengthen the skills you have such as teamwork, communication, learning from others, problem solving through brainstorming:
 + Learning from fellow students
  + Social skills
  + Job interview readiness
  + Engaged collaboration

### How does pair programming work?
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
