#### Table symbol Tables
#### You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe :

###### First Header | Second Header
###### ------------ | -------------
###### Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
###### Content in the first column | Content in the second column


#### GitHub Flavored Markdown
#### GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

#### Note that some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions and comments of Issues and Pull Requests. These include @mentions as well as 
#### references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests. Task Lists are also available in Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files.
