# Markdown
#### Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.  Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.
#### Markdown provides semantic meaning for content in a relatively simple way.
You can write rich formatted content extremely quickly (compared to writing directly in HTML tags)
You can read Markdown easily in plain text before rendered by HTML.

#### Let's learn Markdown
#### These are some elements all Markdown application support these elements.

#### Basic Markdown Syntax

#### Heading: We use # for headings
 - for H1  we use  #
 - for H2 we use - ##
 - for H3 we use - ###

#### Some symbols for the markdown language  :

# Githup 
#### Githup is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.
#### GitHub, can be divided into the Git, and the Hub. The service includes access controls as well as a number of collaboration features like tools for basic task management and for all projects you handle. GitHub hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration. So, the “Git” implies the version control system; a tool which allows developers to keep track of the constant revisions to their code. The “Hub” is the community of like-minded individuals who participate. It is all about the collaborative effort of the community, in reviewing, improving, and deriving new ideas from the uploaded code. It’s definitely something worth looking into!
#### So what are the main benefits of using GitHub?
1. It makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects
 nearly every open-source project uses GitHub to manage their project.

2. Documentation
By using GitHub, you make it easier to get excellent documentation. Their help section and guides have articles for nearly any topic related to git that you can think of.

3. Showcase your work
Are you a developer and wishes to attract recruiters? GitHub is the best tool you can rely on for this. Today, when searching for new recruits for their project, most companies look into the GitHub profiles. If your profile is available, you will have a higher chance of being recruited even if you are not from a great university or college.

4. Markdown
Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write formatted documents. GitHub has revolutionized writing by channeling everything through Markdown: from the issue tracker, user comments, everything. With so many other programming languages to learn for setting up projects, it’s really a big benefit to have your content inputted in a format without having to learn yet another system.

5. GitHub is a repository
This was already mentioned before, but it’s important to note, GitHub is a repository.
What this means that it allows your work to get out there in front of the public. Moreover, GitHub is one of the largest coding communities around right now, so it’s wide exposure for your project.

6. Track changes in your code across versions
When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. Much like using Microsoft Word or Google Drive, you can have a version history of your code so that previous versions are not lost with every iteration.
