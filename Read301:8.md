### What is the REST

Representational State Transfer (REST) 
is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. REST is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP. However, most common REST API implementations use HTTP as the application protocol, and this guide focuses on designing REST APIs for HTTP.

REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.

+ ### identifer of a resource:
A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:  https://adventure-works.com/orders/1  
a GET request to the URI listed above might return this response body:
**{"
orderId":1,
"orderValue":99.90,
"productId":1,
"quantity":1}** 

+ ###  the most common HTTP verbs :
For REST APIs built on HTTP, the uniform interface includes using standard HTTP verbs to perform operations on resources. The most common operations are **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, and **DELETE**.

### URIs be based on :
Sending an HTTP GET request to the collection URI retrieves a list of items in the collection. Each item in the collection also has its own unique URI. An HTTP GET request to the item's URI returns the details of that item.

Adopt a consistent naming convention in URIs. In general, it helps to use plural nouns for URIs that reference collections. It's a good practice to organize URIs for collections and items into a hierarchy. For example, /customers is the path to the customers collection, and /customers/5 is the path to the customer with ID equal to 5. This approach helps to keep the web API intuitive. Also, many web API frameworks can route requests based on parameterized URI paths, so you could define a route for the path /customers/{id}.

For **Good Url** flow the stander rule to build it and Avoid requiring resource URIs more complex than **collection/item/collection**.

### ‘chatty’ web API:
that expose a large number of small resources. Such an API may require a client application to send multiple requests to find all of the data that it requires. Instead, you might want to denormalize the data and combine related information into bigger resources that can be retrieved with a single request. 




## Conform to HTTP semantics
#### GET methods
A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK). If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).


 #### POST methods
If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created).

#### DELETE methods
If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content),
