There are following types of operators in JavaScript.

- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison (Relational) Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators

# Loops
The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using **for**, **while**, **do while** or **for-in loops**. It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.

There are loops in JavaScript.

- for loop
- while loop
- do-while loop
- for-in loop
#### 1) JavaScript For loop
The JavaScript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is known. The syntax of for loop is given below:

#### 2) JavaScript while loop
The JavaScript while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is not known. The syntax of while loop is given below.

 #### 3) JavaScript do while loop
The JavaScript do while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times like while loop. But, code is executed at least once whether condition is true or false. The syntax of do while loop is given below.
