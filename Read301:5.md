# thinking in React( Putting it all together)



The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names
Now that we’ve identified the components in our mock, let’s arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:

* FilterableProductTable
+        -SearchBar
+        -ProductTable
*              -ProductCategoryRow
*              -ProductRow

##### each componetn has it's  responsibility:
+ FilterableProductTable (orange): contains the entirety of the example
+ SearchBar (blue): receives all user input
+ ProductTable (green): displays and filters the data collection based on user input
+ ProductCategoryRow (turquoise): displays a heading for each category
+ ProductRow (red): displays a row for each product

##### Static version 
To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props are a way of passing data from parent to child
** don’t use state ** at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.

that's mean build a non-interactive app .

** At the end **, you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have render() methods since this is a static version of your app.

Then now you need To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs .

 **DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself**  Ask three questions about each piece of data:

+ Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
+ Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
+ Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

######  identify where state needs to live 
+ Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
+ Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
+ Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
+ If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
