## NextJs Dynamic Routes
 
 we’ll talk about the case where each page path depends on external data. Next.js allows you to statically generate pages with paths that depend on external data. This enables dynamic URLs in Next.js.

 ### How to Statically Generate Pages with Dynamic Routes
In our case, we want to create dynamic routes for blog posts:

We want each post to have the path `/posts/<id>`, where `<id>` is the name of the markdown file under the top-level `posts` directory.
Since we have `ssg-ssr.md` and `pre-rendering.md`, we’d like the paths to be `/posts/ssg-ssr` and `/posts/pre-rendering`.

```
import Layout from '../../components/layout'

export default function Post() {
  return <Layout>...</Layout>
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Return a list of possible value for id
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Fetch necessary data for the blog post using params.id
}
```

###   Implement getStaticPaths
```
export function getAllPostIds() {
  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory)

  // Returns an array that looks like this:
  // [
  //   {
  //     params: {
  //       id: 'ssg-ssr'
  //     }
  //   },
  //   {
  //     params: {
  //       id: 'pre-rendering'
  //     }
  //   }
  // ]
  return fileNames.map(fileName => {
    return {
      params: {
        id: fileName.replace(/\.md$/, '')
      }
    }
  })
}
```
```
import { getAllPostIds } from '../../lib/posts'

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const paths = getAllPostIds()
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false
  }
}
```
### Implement getStaticProps

```
export function getPostData(id) {
  const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${id}.md`)
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')

  // Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section
  const matterResult = matter(fileContents)

  // Combine the data with the id
  return {
    id,
    ...matterResult.data
  }
}


```

Then, open pages/posts/[id].js and replace this line:

```
import { getAllPostIds, getPostData } from '../../lib/posts'

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const postData = getPostData(params.id)
  return {
    props: {
      postData
    }
  }
}
```
The post page is now using the getPostData function in getStaticProps to get the post data and return it as props.

Now, let's update the Post component to use postData. In pages/posts/[id].js replace the exported Post component with the following code:



```
export default function Post({ postData }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {postData.title}
      <br />
      {postData.id}
      <br />
      {postData.date}
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

## Deploying Your Next.js App

+ Push to GitHub
+ Deploy to Vercel
The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform developed by the creators of Next.js.

Vercel is a serverless platform for static and hybrid applications built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database. We make it easy for frontend teams to develop, preview, and ship delightful user experiences, where performance is the default. You can start using it for free — no credit card required.
### Next.js and Vercel
Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js. When you deploy your Next.js app to Vercel, the following happens by default:

+ Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, which is blazingly fast.
+ Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.

Vercel has many more features, such as:

+ Custom Domains: Once deployed on Vercel, you can assign a custom domain to your Next.js app. Take a look at our documentation here.
+ Environment Variables: You can also set environment variables on Vercel. Take a look at our documentation here. You can then use those environment variables in your Next.js app.
+ Automatic HTTPS: HTTPS is enabled by default (including custom domains) and doesn't require extra configuration. We auto-renew SSL certificates.

After deploying to Vercel, try doing the following if you can:

+ Create a new branch on your app.
+ Make some changes and push to GitHub.
+ Create a new pull request (GitHub help page).

You should see a comment by the vercel bot on the pull request page.
#### Develop, Preview, Ship
We’ve just gone through the workflow we call DPS: Develop, Preview, and Ship.

+ Develop: We’ve written code in Next.js and used the Next.js development server running to take advantage of its hot reloading feature.
+ Preview: We’ve pushed changes to a branch on GitHub, and Vercel created a preview deployment that’s available via a URL. We can share this preview URL with others for feedback. In addition to doing code reviews, you can do deployment previews.
+ Ship: We’ve merged the pull request to main to ship to production.


### Other Hosting Options
Next.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js.

If you’ve followed the instructions so far, your package.json should have the following build and start scripts:
```
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```
