#  Beginners Guide to Big O
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. ... In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

## O(1)
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

bool IsFirstElementNull(IList<String> elements)
{
    return elements[0] == null;
}
O(N)
O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. The example below also demonstrates how Big O favours the worst-case performance scenario; a matching string could be found during any iteration of the for loop and the function would return early, but Big O notation will always assume the upper limit where the algorithm will perform the maximum number of iterations.

bool ContainsValue(IEnumerable<string> elements, string value)
{
    foreach (var element in elements)
    {
        if (element == value) return true; 
    }     
    return false; 
}
## O(N²)
O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N³), O(N⁴) etc.

bool ContainsDuplicates(IList<string> elements)
{
    for (var outer = 0; outer < elements.Count; outer++) 
    {
        for (var inner = 0; inner < elements.Count; inner++) 
        { 
            // Don't compare with self 
            if (outer == inner) continue;             
            
            if (elements[outer] == elements[inner]) return true; 
        }
    }    
    return false;
}
## O(2^N)
O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential — starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically. An example of an O(2^N) function is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers:

int Fibonacci(int number)
{
    if (number <= 1) return number;
       
    return Fibonacci(number - 2) + Fibonacci(number - 1); 
}

## O(log n) 
O(log N) basically means time goes up linearly while the n goes up exponentially. So if it takes 1 second to compute 10 elements, it will take 2 seconds to compute 100 elements, 3 seconds to compute 1000 elements, and so on.
