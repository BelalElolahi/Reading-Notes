## Regular Expressions 
Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not. If you've ever used search engines, search and replace tools of word processors and text editors - you've already seen regular expressions in use. They are used at the server side to validate the format of email addresses or passwords during registration, used for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc. They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data science projects involving text mining.



### Regular Expressions in Python 
Then you will see how `basic/ordinary character`s are used for performing matches, followed by `wild or special characters`. Next, you'll learn about using `repetitions` in your regular expressions. You'll also learn how to create` groups and named groups` within your search for ease of access to matches. Next, you'll get familiar with the concept of greedy vs. `non-greedy matching`.

very useful functions provided by the `re` library, such as:` compile()`, `search()`, `findall()`, `sub()` for search and replace, s`plit()`, and some more. You will also learn about `compilation flags` that you can use to make your regex better.


In Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. That means that if you want to start using them in your Python scripts, you have to import this module with the help of import:
```
import re
```
The re library in Python provides several functions that make it a skill worth mastering . 

### Basic Patterns: Ordinary Characters
```
pattern = r"Cookie"
sequence = "Cookie"
if re.match(pattern, sequence):
    print("Match!")
else: print("Not a match!")
```


### Wild Card Characters: Special Characters
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/684/1*Q70da0n7q90b5x4d6Df8-w.png)
`.`- A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.
```
re.search(r'Co.k.e', 'Cookie').group()
'Cookie'
```
`^` - A caret. Matches the start of the string.

```
re.search(r'cake$', "Cake! Let's eat cake").group()


'cake'
```


`$` - Matches the end of string.
```
re.search(r'cake$', "Cake! Let's eat cake").group()

## The next search will return the NONE value, try it:
# re.search(r'cake$', "Let's get some cake on our way home!").group()
'cake'
```

``[abc]`` - Matches a or b or c.
``[a-zA-Z0-9]`` - Matches any letter from (a to z) or (A to Z) or (0 to 9).

```
re.search(r'[0-6]', 'Number: 5').group()

'5'
```

`\` - Backslash.
Perhaps, the most diverse metacharacter!!


`\w` - Lowercase 'w'. Matches any single letter, digit, or underscore.
`\W` - Uppercase 'W'. Matches any character not part of \w (lowercase w).

`\s` - Lowercase 's'. Matches a single whitespace character like: space, newline, tab, return.


`\S` - Uppercase 'S'. Matches any character not part of \s (lowercase s).

`\d` - Lowercase d. Matches decimal digit 0-9.


`\D` - Uppercase d. Matches any character that is not a decimal digit.


`\t `- Lowercase t. Matches tab.

`\n` - Lowercase n. Matches newline.

`\r` - Lowercase r. Matches return.

`\A` - Uppercase a. Matches only at the start of the string. Works across multiple lines as well.

`\Z` - Uppercase z. Matches only at the end of the string.

TIP: `^` and` \A` are effectively the same, and so are` $` and `\Z`. Except when dealing with





### Repetitions 
It becomes quite tedious if you are looking to find long patterns in a sequence. Fortunately, the `re` module handles repetitions using the following special characters:

`+` - Checks if the preceding character appears one or more times starting from that position.
```
re.search(r'Co+kie', 'Cooookie').group()
```
```
'Cooookie'
```
`*` - Checks if the preceding character appears zero or more times starting from that position.

```
# Checks for any occurrence of a or o or both in the given sequence
re.search(r'Ca*o*kie', 'Cookie').group()
```
```
'Cookie'
```
`?` - Checks if the preceding character appears exactly zero or one time starting from that position.
```
# Checks for exactly zero or one occurrence of a or o or both in the given sequence
re.search(r'Colou?r', 'Color').group()
```
```
'Color'
```
But what if you want to check for an exact number of sequence repetition?

For example, checking the validity of a phone number in an application. re module handles this very gracefully as well using the following regular expressions:

{`x}` - Repeat exactly x number of times.
`{x,}` - Repeat at least x times or more.
`{x, y}` - Repeat at least x times but no more than y times.
```
re.search(r'\d{9,10}', '0987654321').group()
```
```
'0987654321'
```
The `+` and `*` qualifiers are said to be greedy. You will see what this means later on.


### Grouping in Regular Expressions
The group feature of regular expression allows you to pick up parts of the matching text. Parts of a regular expression pattern bounded by parenthesis `()` are called groups. The parenthesis does not change what the expression matches, but rather forms groups within the matched sequence. You have been using the `group()` function all along in this tutorial's examples. The plain `match.group()` without any argument is still the whole matched text as usual.
```
statement = 'Please contact us at: support@datacamp.com'
match = re.search(r'([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)', statement)
if statement:
  print("Email address:", match.group()) # The whole matched text
  print("Username:", match.group(1)) # The username (group 1)
  print("Host:", match.group(2)) # The host (group 2)
```

```
Email address: support@datacamp.com
Username: support
Host: datacamp.com
```


### Greedy vs. Non-Greedy Matching
When a special character matches as much of the search sequence (string) as possible, it is said to be a "Greedy Match". It is the normal behavior of a regular expression, but sometimes this behavior is not desired:


```
pattern = "cookie"
sequence = "Cake and cookie"

heading  = r'<h1>TITLE</h1>'
re.match(r'<.*>', heading).group()
```
```
'<h1>TITLE</h1>'

```

## High-level file operations in Python (shutil)

The `copy()` function interprets the output name like the Unix command line tool cp. If the named destination refers to a directory instead of a file, a new file is created in the directory using the base name of the source. The permissions of the file are copied along with the contents.
```
from shutil import *
import os

os.mkdir('example')
print 'BEFORE:', os.listdir('example')
copy('shutil_copy.py', 'example')
print 'AFTER:', os.listdir('example')
```
```
$ python shutil_copy.py

BEFORE: []
AFTER: ['shutil_copy.py']
```

`copy2()` works like` copy()`, but includes the access and modification times in the meta-data copied to the new file.
```
from shutil import *
import os
import time

def show_file_info(filename):
    stat_info = os.stat(filename)
    print '\tMode    :', stat_info.st_mode
    print '\tCreated :', time.ctime(stat_info.st_ctime)
    print '\tAccessed:', time.ctime(stat_info.st_atime)
    print '\tModified:', time.ctime(stat_info.st_mtime)

os.mkdir('example')
print 'SOURCE:'
show_file_info('shutil_copy2.py')
copy2('shutil_copy2.py', 'example')
print 'DEST:'
show_file_info('example/shutil_copy2.py')
```
```
$ python shutil_copy2.py

SOURCE:
        Mode    : 33188
        Created : Sat Jul 16 12:28:43 2011
        Accessed: Thu Feb 21 06:36:54 2013
        Modified: Sat Feb 19 19:18:23 2011
DEST:
        Mode    : 33188
        Created : Thu Feb 21 06:36:54 2013
        Accessed: Thu Feb 21 06:36:54 2013
        Modified: Sat Feb 19 19:18:23 20
```
### Copying File Meta-data 
To copy other meta-data about the file (permissions, last access time, and last modified time), use copystat().
```
from shutil import *
import os
import time

def show_file_info(filename):
    stat_info = os.stat(filename)
    print '\tMode    :', stat_info.st_mode
    print '\tCreated :', time.ctime(stat_info.st_ctime)
    print '\tAccessed:', time.ctime(stat_info.st_atime)
    print '\tModified:', time.ctime(stat_info.st_mtime)

f = open('file_to_change.txt', 'wt')
f.write('content')
f.close()
os.chmod('file_to_change.txt', 0444)

print 'BEFORE:'
show_file_info('file_to_change.txt')
copystat('shutil_copystat.py', 'file_to_change.txt')
print 'AFTER :'
show_file_info('file_to_change.txt')
```
```
$ python shutil_copystat.py

BEFORE:
        Mode    : 33060
        Created : Thu Feb 21 06:36:54 2013
        Accessed: Thu Feb 21 06:36:54 2013
        Modified: Thu Feb 21 06:36:54 2013
AFTER :
        Mode    : 33188
        Created : Thu Feb 21 06:36:54 2013
        Accessed: Thu Feb 21 06:36:54 2013
        Modified: Sat Feb 19 19:18:23 
```

### Working With Directory Trees
shutil includes 3 functions for working with directory trees. To copy a directory from one place to another, use `copytree()`. It recurses through the source directory tree, copying files to the destination. The destination directory must not exist in advance. The symlinks argument controls whether symbolic links are copied as links or as files. The default is to copy the contents to new files. If the option is true, new symlinks are created within the destination tree.
```
from shutil import *
from commands import *

print 'BEFORE:'
print getoutput('ls -rlast /tmp/example')
copytree('example', '/tmp/example')
print 'AFTER:'
print getoutput('ls -rlast /tmp/example')
```
```
$ python shutil_copytree.py

BEFORE:
ls: /tmp/example: No such file or directory
AFTER:
total 8
8 -rw-r--r--   1 dhellmann  wheel  1595 Feb 19  2011 shutil_copy2.py
0 drwxrwxrwt  19 root       wheel   646 Feb 21 06:36 ..
0 drwxr-xr-x   3 dhellmann  wheel   
```


To remove a directory and its contents, use `rmtree()`. Errors are raised as exceptions by default, but can be ignored if the second argument is true, and a special error handler function can be provided in the third argument.
```
from shutil import *
from commands import *

print 'BEFORE:'
print getoutput('ls -rlast /tmp/example')
rmtree('/tmp/example')
print 'AFTER:'
print getoutput('ls -rlast /tmp/example')
```
```
$ python shutil_rmtree.py

BEFORE:
total 8
8 -rw-r--r--   1 dhellmann  wheel  1595 Feb 19  2011 shutil_copy2.py
0 drwxrwxrwt  19 root       wheel   646 Feb 21 06:36 ..
0 drwxr-xr-x   3 dhellmann  wheel   102 Feb 21 06:36 .
AFTER:
ls: /tmp/example: No such file or directory
```


To move a file or directory from one place to another, use `move()`. The semantics are similar to those of the Unix command mv. If the source and destination are within the same filesystem, the source is simply renamed. Otherwise the source is copied to the destination and then the source is removed.
```
from shutil import *
from glob import glob

f = open('example.txt', 'wt')
f.write('contents')
f.close()

print 'BEFORE: ', glob('example*')
move('example.txt', 'example.out')
print 'AFTER : ', glob('example*')
```
```
$ python shutil_move.py

BEFORE:  ['example.txt']
AFTER :  ['example.out']
```
