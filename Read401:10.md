# Stacks and Queues 

##  Stacks 

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out)


### How to understand a stack practically? 
There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider the simple example of plates stacked over one another in a canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow the LIFO/FILO order.

### Operations on stak: 

`PUSH Operation`
Push operation refers to inserting an element in the stack. Since there’s only one position at which the new element can be inserted — Top of the stack, the new element is inserted at the top of the stack.

`POP Operation`
Pop operation refers to the removal of an element. Again, since we only have access to the element at the top of the stack, there’s only one element that we can remove. We just remove the top of the stack. Note: We can also choose to return the value of the popped element back, its completely at the choice of the programmer to implement this.

`PEEK Operation`
Peek operation allows the user to see the element on the top of the stack. The stack is not modified in any manner in this operation.

`isEmpty` Check if stack is empty or not




### Time Complexities of operations on stack:

`push()`, `pop()`, `isEmpty`() and `peek()` all take **O(1)** time. We do not run any loop in any of these operations.











## Queues
Like Stack, Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).  A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

### How to understand a Queue practically? 
Applications of Queue: 
Queue is used when things don’t have to be processed immediately, but have to be processed in First InFirst Out order like Breadth First Search. This property of Queue makes it also useful in following kind of scenarios.

**1)** When a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling. 

**2)** When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two processes. Examples include IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.








### Operations on Queue: 
Mainly the following four basic operations are performed on queue:

`Enqueue` Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition. 

`Dequeue` Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition. 

`Front` Get the front item from queue. 

`Rear` Get the last item from queue. 




### Time Complexities of operations on Queue:

              
`Enque(insertion)`,   `Deque(deletion)`,`Front(Get front)`,  `Rear(Get Rear)`  all take **O(1)** time.
