# Django CRUD and Forms
## HTML Forms
First a brief overview of HTML Forms. Consider a simple HTML form, with a single text field for entering the name of some "team", and its associated label: 

![](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms/form_example_name_field.png)


The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside <form>...</form> tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit". 

```
<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>
```


While here we just have one text field for entering the team name, a form may have any number of other input elements and their associated labels. The field's type attribute defines what sort of widget will be displayed. The name and id of the field are used to identify the field in JavaScript/CSS/HTML, while value defines the initial value for the field when it is first displayed. The matching team label is specified using the label tag (see "Enter name" above), with a for field containing the id value of the associated input.

The submit input will be displayed as a button (by default) that can be pressed by the user to upload the data in all the other input elements in the form to the server (in this case, just the team_name). The form attributes define the HTTP method used to send the data and the destination of the data on the server (action):

+ action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), then the form will be submitted back to the current page URL.

+ method: The HTTP method used to send the data: post or get.
The POST method should always be used if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database because this can be made more resistant to cross-site forgery request attacks.
The GET method should only be used for forms that don't change user data (e.g. a search form). It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL.


## Django form handling process
Django's form handling uses all of the same techniques that we learned about in previous tutorials (for displaying information about our models): the view gets a request, performs any actions required including reading data from the models, then generates and returns an HTML page (from a template, into which we pass a context containing the data to be displayed). What makes things more complicated is that the server also needs to be able to process data provided by the user, and redisplay the page if there are any errors.


#### The Django Form class
At the heart of this system of components is Django’s Form class. In much the same way that a Django model describes the logical structure of an object, its behavior, and the way its parts are represented to us, a Form class describes a form and determines how it works and appears.

In a similar way that a model class’s fields map to database fields, a form class’s fields map to HTML form <input> elements. (A ModelForm maps a model class’s fields to HTML form <input> elements via a Form; this is what the Django admin is based upon.)

A form’s fields are themselves classes; they manage form data and perform validation when a form is submitted. A DateField and a FileField handle very different kinds of data and have to do different things with it.

A form field is represented to a user in the browser as an HTML “widget” - a piece of user interface machinery. Each field type has an appropriate default Widget class, but these can be overridden as required.

```
from django import forms

class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
    sender = forms.EmailField()
    cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)

```


A process flowchart of how Django handles form requests is shown below, starting with a request for a page containing a form (shown in green).

Based on the diagram above, the main things that Django's form handling does are:

+ Display the default form  the first time it is requested by the user.
  + The form may contain blank fields (e.g. if you're creating a new record), or it may be pre-populated with initial values (e.g. if you are changing a record, or have useful default initial values).
   + The form is referred to as unbound at this point, because it isn't associated with any user-entered data (though it may have initial values).


+ Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.
  + Binding data to the form means that the user-entered data and any errors are available when we need to redisplay the form.

+ Clean and validate the data.
   + the data performs sanitization of the input (e.g. removing invalid characters that might be used to send malicious content to the server) and converts them into consistent Python types.
  + Validation checks that the values are appropriate for the field (e.g. are in the right date range, aren't too short or too long, etc.)



+ If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.

+ If all data is valid, perform required actions (e.g. save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, etc.)
+ Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.
