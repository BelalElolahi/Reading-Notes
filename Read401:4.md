## Classes and Objects 
Objects : 

 are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. 

Classes :

 are essentially a template to create your objects.

code Examples : 
 >>>
  >>>class MyClass:
    >>>variable = "blah"

  >>> def function(self):
  >>>  print("This is a message inside the class.")

>>>myobjectx = MyClass()
>>>
myobjectx.variable


#### Accessing Object Functions
To access a function inside of an object you use notation similar to accessing a variable:
>>
  class MyClass:
   >>
    variable = "blah"
>>
    def function(self):
    >>
  print("This is a message inside the class.")
>>
myobjectx = MyClass()
>>
myobjectx.function()

## Thinking Recursively
 The term Recursion can be defined as the process of defining something in terms of itself. In simple words, it is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly. Sequence creation is simpler through recursion than utilizing any nested iteration

 Now that we have some intuition about recursion, let’s introduce the formal definition of a recursive function. A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.

To demonstrate this structure, let’s write a recursive function for calculating n!:

Decompose the original problem into simpler instances of the same problem. This is the recursive case:
>>
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1
>>
n! = n x (n−1)!

As the large problem is broken down into successively less complex ones, those subproblems must eventually become so simple that they can be solved without further subdivision. This is the base case:
>>
n! = n x (n−1)! 
>>
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2)!
>>
>>
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3)!
⋅
⋅
>>
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3!
>>
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2!
>>
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1!


#### Maintaining State
When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:

Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context
Keep the state in global scope
A demonstration should make things clearer. Let’s calculate 1 + 2 + 3 ⋅⋅⋅⋅ + 10 using recursion. The state that we have to maintain is (current number we are adding, accumulated sum till now).

#### Recursive Data Structures in Python
A data structure is recursive if it can be deﬁned in terms of a smaller version of itself. A list is an example of a recursive data structure. Let me demonstrate. Assume that you have only an empty list at your disposal, and the only operation you can perform on it is this:

 Return a new list that is the result of
 adding element to the head (i.e. front) of input_list
def attach_head(element, input_list):
    return [element] + input_list

## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

Fixtures
When you're writing tests, you're rarely going to write just one or two. Rather, you're going to write an entire "test suite", with each test aiming to check a different path through your code. In many cases, this means you'll have a few tests with similar characteristics, something that pytest handles with "parametrized tests".

But in other cases, things are a bit more complex. You'll want to have some objects available to all of your tests. Those objects might contain data you want to share across tests, or they might involve the network or filesystem. These are often known as "fixtures" in the testing world, and they take a variety of different forms.  



>>
In pytest, you define fixtures using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator, along with a function definition. For example, say you have a file that returns a list of lines from a file, in which each line is reversed:

>>>>>
def reverse_lines(f):
>>>>>
   return [one_line.rstrip()[::-1] + '\n'
        >>>>>      
   for one_line in f]

Note that in order to avoid the newline character from being placed at the start of the line, you remove it from the string before reversing and then add a '\n' in each returned string. Also note that although it probably would be a good idea to use a generator expression rather than a list comprehension, I'm trying to keep things relatively simple here.

If you're going to test this function, you'll need to pass it a file-like object. In my last article, I showed how you could use a StringIO object for such a thing, and that remains the case. But rather than defining global variables in your test file, you can create a fixture that'll provide your test with the appropriate object at the right time.

Here's how that looks in pytest:

>>>>>
@pytest.fixture
>>>>>
def simple_file():
 >>>>>
   return StringIO('\n'.join(['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']))
>>>>>


#### Coverage
This is all great, but if you've ever done any testing, you know there's always the question of how thoroughly you have tested your code. After all, let's say you've written five functions, and that you've written tests for all of them. Can you be sure you've actually tested all of the possible paths through those functions?

For example, let's assume you have a very strange function, only_odd_mul, which multiplies only odd numbers:

>>>>
def only_odd_mul(x, y):
>>>>
   if x%2 and y%2:
   >>>>
       return x * y
>>>>
   else:
    >>>>
       raise NoEvenNumbersHereException(f'{x} and/or {y}
 >>>>
 ↪not odd')

Here's a test you can run on it:

>>>>
def test_odd_numbers():
   >>>>
   assert only_odd_mul(3, 5) == 15

#### Summary
If you haven't guessed from my three-part focus on pytest, I've been bowled over by the way this testing system has been designed. After years of hanging my head in shame when talking about testing, I've started to incorporate it into my code, including in my online "Weekly Python Exercise" course. If I can get into testing, so can you. And although I haven't covered everything pytest offers, you now should have a good sense of what it is and how to start using it.
