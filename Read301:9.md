# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

## What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable. Given the same parameters, pure functions will always return the same result. We don’t need to think of situations when the same parameter has different results — because it will never happen.

The function return values are identical for identical arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams).
The function application has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input/output streams).

## What are the benefits of a pure function?
+ The code’s definitely easier to test. 
 + We don’t need to mock anything. 
 + So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D


## What is immutability?
### (Unchanging over time or unable to be changed)
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
## What is Referential transparency?
Referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior

# node js 

### What is a module?
In Node. js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicates with an external application on the basis of their related functionality. Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders
### What does the word ‘require’ do?
CommonJS module system, and the built-in require function is the easiest way to include modules that exist in separate files. The basic functionality of require is that it reads a JavaScript file, executes the file, and then proceeds to return the exports object.
### How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
Imoort the path of this file USE Rquire
