# Permissions & Postgresql

### How permissions are determined
Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.

Before running the main body of the view each permission in the list is checked. If any permission check fails, `an exceptions.PermissionDenied` or `exceptions.NotAuthenticated `exception will be raised, and the main body of the view will not run.

When the permission checks fail, either a "403 Forbidden" or a "401 Unauthorized" response will be returned, according to the following rules:

+ The request was successfully authenticated, but permission was denied. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
+ The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does not use `WWW-Authenticate headers`. — An HTTP 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
+ The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does use` WWW-Authenticate headers`. — An HTTP 401 Unauthorized response, with an appropriate `WWW-Authenticate header `will be returned.

### Object level permissions
REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning. Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.

Object level permissions are run by REST framework's generic views when `.get_object()` is called. As with view level permissions, an `exceptions.PermissionDenied `exception will be raised if the user is not allowed to act on the given object.

If you're writing your own views and want to enforce object level permissions, or if you override the `get_object` method on a generic view, then you'll need to explicitly call the `.check_object_permissions(request, obj)` method on the view at the point at which you've retrieved the object.

This will either raise a `PermissionDenied` or `NotAuthenticated` exception, or simply return if the view has the appropriate permissions.

### For example: 
```
def get_object(self):
    obj = get_object_or_404(self.get_queryset(), pk=self.kwargs["pk"])
    self.check_object_permissions(self.request, obj)
    return obj
```

### Setting the permission policy
The default permission policy may be set globally, using the `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES` setting. For example.

```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ]
}
```
If not specified, this setting defaults to allowing unrestricted access:

```
'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
   'rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny',
]
```
You can also set the authentication policy on a per-view, or per-viewset basis, using the APIView class-based views.

```
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content)
```

Or, if you're using the @api_view decorator with function based views.

```
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response

@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def example_view(request, format=None):
    content = {
        'status': 'request was permitted'
    }
    return Response(content)
```

**note** : when you set new permission classes via the class attribute or decorators you're telling the view to ignore the default list set in the settings.py file.

Provided they inherit from rest_framework.permissions.BasePermission, permissions can be composed using standard Python bitwise operators. For example, IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly could be written:

```
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission, IsAuthenticated, SAFE_METHODS
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ReadOnly(BasePermission):
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        return request.method in SAFE_METHODS

class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated|ReadOnly]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content)
```


## Postgresql

### What is PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of active development on the core platform.

PostgreSQL has earned a strong reputation for its proven architecture, reliability, data integrity, robust feature set, extensibility, and the dedication of the open source community behind the software to consistently deliver performant and innovative solutions. PostgreSQL runs on all major operating systems, has been ACID-compliant since 2001, and has powerful add-ons such as the popular PostGIS geospatial database extender. It is no surprise that PostgreSQL has become the open source relational database of choice for many people and organisations.

Getting started with using PostgreSQL has never been easier - pick a project you want to build, and let PostgreSQL safely and robustly store your data.

### Why use PostgreSQL?
PostgreSQL comes with many features aimed to help developers build applications, administrators to protect data integrity and build fault-tolerant environments, and help you manage your data no matter how big or small the dataset. In addition to being free and open source, PostgreSQL is highly extensible. For example, you can define your own data types, build out custom functions, even write code from different programming languages without recompiling your database!

PostgreSQL tries to conform with the SQL standard where such conformance does not contradict traditional features or could lead to poor architectural decisions. Many of the features required by the SQL standard are supported, though sometimes with slightly differing syntax or function. Further moves towards conformance can be expected over time. As of the version 14 release in September 2021, PostgreSQL conforms to at least 170 of the 179 mandatory features for SQL:2016 Core conformance. As of this writing, no relational database meets full conformance with this standard.
