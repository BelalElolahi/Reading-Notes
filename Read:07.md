# JavaScript functions and operators
### What is the functions:
#### Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

#### A JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword.

#### Syntax:
###### //defining a function
###### function <function-name>()
###### {
   ######  // code to be executed
###### };

###### //calling a function
###### <function-name>();

#### Here are several advantages of using functions in your code:

##### Use of functions enhances the readability of a program. A big code is always difficult to read. Breaking the code in smaller Functions keeps the program organized, easy to understand and makes it reusable.
##### The C compiler follows top-to-down execution, so the control flow can be easily managed in case of functions. The control will always come back to the main() function.
##### It reduces the complexity of a program and gives it a modular structure.
##### In case we need to test only a particular part of the program we will have to run the whole program and figure out the errors which can be quite a complex process. Another advantage here is that functions can be individually tested which is more convenient than the above mentioned process.
##### A function can be used to create our own header file which can be used in any number of programs i.e. the reusability.

## Control flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 



## operators 
### There are following types of operators in JavaScript.

- Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison (Relational) Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators
